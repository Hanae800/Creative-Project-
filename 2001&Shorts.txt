The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years,
and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter-
rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent
which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival
had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not
yet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or
the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.
The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and
they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.
About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking
a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.
The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.
As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher
discovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know
the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond
his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-
iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then
he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the
hyenas.
Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly
five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over
a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,
and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is
low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he
unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As
he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already
something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those
dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-
tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another
two million years.
As the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach
the shallow stream.
The Others are already there. They were there on the other
side every day - that did not make it any less annoying.
There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish
them from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. As
they see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and
shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply
In kind.
The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies
out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of
the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has
staked its claim to its own territory.
Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit
and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around
them, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential
source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet
all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched
savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;
the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are
slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.
The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-
side foraging for roots and occasional berries.
Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,
about fifty feet apart.
The ground is flat for miles around.
Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking
them about 300 yards away.
Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all
directions, but the lion brings one to the ground.
It had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no
real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day
with another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a
hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the
finest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he
also collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices
them. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever
likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually
weak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could
hope for.
Over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down
from the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -
but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;
it was merely part of the background of life.
This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,
was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher
crawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides
the entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.
If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back
to the relative safety of the cave.
Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher's
race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,
and though he could not remember it, when he was young,
Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.
Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high
enough.
He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from
one of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the
occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down
there in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,
and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses
Moonwatcher's mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out
such fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.
And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and
fearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations
yet to come.
The Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of
the valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that
Moonwatcher's tribe has lost three of its numbers during the
night, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When
they meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a
deeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy
but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds
before the invasion begins.
In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,
shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led
by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher's own size and age.
Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first
advance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations
at the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a
mist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own
territory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.
He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his
experience.
Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing
down, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they
move from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy
they become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original
drive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.
As he sees this, Moonwatcher's own morale immediately
revives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make
reassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill
his dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and
leadership.
Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and
the two tribes come to a halt many paces away.
The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended
quickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this
innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the
future. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and
scratch and try to bite each other.
Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,
and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance,
he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth's scalp,
and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is
so satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening
In Big - Tooth's resistance, that he quickly repeats it.
Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-
watcher keeps up the exhilirating game.
With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the
stream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as
The water's edge.
Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is
startled by a sound.
He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his
senses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.
Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of
his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The
great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that
betrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional
cracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise
that grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous
beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at
concealment, and ignoring all obstacles.
And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not
possibly have identified, for it had never been heard before
in the history of this planet.
Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he
leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.
He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing
had happened after that initial noise, so he does not even
associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There
is nothing in the least alarming about it.
It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of
some completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy
to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.
There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can
compare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious
of most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.
As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,
hard surface.
After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a
brilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it
must have grown during the night. There are many plants
that do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that
seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that
they are small and round, whereas this is large and square;
but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be
prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.
This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher
to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,
round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few
that made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?
A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.
There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he
continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.
They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the
sound begins.
It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they
stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,
maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube
and hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first
time - and the last, for two million year - the sound of
drumming is heard in Africa.
The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the
hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards
the source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little
dancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that
their descendants will not create for ages yet.
Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting
the hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,
and the hunger in their bellies.
Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes
fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance,
rotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-
eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.
Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than all
that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It
is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and
shifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four
hominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher's
own tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog
lies near them.
This little family of male and female and two children is gorged
and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a
condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From
time to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the
entrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.
The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally
different scene.
The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;
it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.
A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids
without giving them more than a glance, for they had never been
the slightest danger to its species.
But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male
suddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -
and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon
its skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had
produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.
And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one
amazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.
Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds
itself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement
can be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the
pig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene
freezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless
above the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.
The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a
glimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if
awakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle
back to their caves.
They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that
night, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears
attuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher
feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge
to kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.
Babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-
year-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others
threatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.
In the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions
had changed almost beyond recognition.
They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no
longer haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons
well; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that
the Cube had revealed to them.
They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they
had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.
Their new way of life was casually accepted, and they did
not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing
outside their cave.
But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The
first was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids
seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better
nourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for
somehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to
die of starvation.
With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the
ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-
watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two
consecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,
betraying his presences by a small pebble slide.
When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,
they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound
of the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave
against the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their
strength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.
The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these
creatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost
him his life; he goes back to his meal.
The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with
amazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about
fifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.
Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps
away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the
onrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-
confidence and bad luck.
The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They
also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to
see what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small
rock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to
pay for such a great victory.
And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even
Moonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly
unaware of all that it had done.
From their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of
their own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen
males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-
looking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.
The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today
something is different, though the Others do not immediatly
recognize this fact.
Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,
Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and
begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness
never befor seen.
As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the
morning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness
of this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to
an uneasy silence.
At the water's edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They
carry their bone clubs and bone knives.
Led by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-
chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts
the sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their
hearts.
Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who
walked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his
hand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is
the bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick,
displaying its frightful fangs.
The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.
Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high.
Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled
standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed
by his band.
The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even
the ability to flee.
Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands
unsurely in front of his band.
Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge,
One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first
displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked
with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club
until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness
down around him.
The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher's power.
Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the
world, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would
think of something.					  
Oh, please don't worry about it.
Well, thank you very much for
being so understanding.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant
flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through
Documentation?
Fine.
Will you use number eight,
please?
Thank you, Miss Turner.
Good morning and welcome to voice
Print Identification. When you see
the red light go on would you please
state in the following order; your
desitination, your nationality and
your full name. Surname first,
christian name and initial. For
example: Moon, American,
Smith, John, D. Thank you.
Moon, American, Floyd, Heywood,
I've always wondered....
(Interrupting)  Thank you. Despite
and excellent and continually
improving safety record there are
certain risks inherent in space
travel and an extremely high cost
of pay load. Because of this it
is necessary for the Space Carrier
to advise you that it cannot be
responsible for the return of your
body to Earth should you become
deceased on the Moon or en route
to the Moon. However, it wishes
to advise you that insurance
covering this contingency is
available in the Main Lounge.
Thank you. You are cleared
through Voice Print Identification.
I've reserved a table for you in
the Earth Light room. Your
connecting flight will be
leaving in about one hour.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Let's see, we haven't had the
pleasure of a visit from you not
since... It was about eight or
nine months ago, wasn't it?
Yes, I think so. Just about
then.
I suppose you saw the work on
our new section while you
were docking.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Oh, look, I've got to make a
phone call. Why don't you go
on into the Restaurant and I'll
meet you in there.
Fine. I'll see you at the bar.
Hello.
Hello, darling, how are you?
Hello Daddy. Where are you?
I'm at Space Station Five,
darling. How are you?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are
you coming home?
Well, I hope in a few days,
sweetheart.
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I
told you I won't be home for a
few days.
When are you coming home?
In three days, darling, I
hope.
One, two, three. Can I
speak to Mommy?
Mommy's out to the hair-
dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I
have to go now. Tell Mommy
that I called.
How many days until you
come home?
Three, darling. One... two
... three. Be sure to tell
Mommy I called.
I will, Daddy.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a
lovely Birthday Party
tomorrow.
Thank you, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy
Birthday now and I'll see you
soon. All right, Darling?
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Good morning, Macy's.
Good morning. I'd like the
Vision shopper for the Pet
Shop, please.
Just one moment.
Good morning, sir, may I help you?
Yes, I'd like to buy a bush baby.
Just a moment, sir.
Here you are, sir. Here is a
lovely assortment of African
bush babies. They are twenty
Dollars each.
Yes, well... Pick out a nice one
for me, a friendly one, and I'd
like it delivered tomorrow.
Certainly, sir. Just let us have
your name and Bank identification
for V.P.I., and then give the
name and address of the person
you'd like the pet delivered to
and it will be delivered tomorrow.
Thank you very much. Floyd,
Heywood, R.,  First National
Bank of Washington. Please
deliver to Miss Josephine
Floyd, 9423 Dupre Avenue,
N.W.14.
Thank you very much, sir. It
will be delivered tomorrow.
Well, how nice to see you again,
Elena. You're looking wonderful.
How nice to see you, Hyewood.
This is my good friend, Dr.
Heywood Floyd. I'd like you
to meet Andre Smyslov...
And this is Dr. Kalinan...
Stretyneva...
Dr. Floyd, won't you join us
for a drink?
I'm afraid I've only got a few
minutes, but I'd love to.
What would you like to drink?
Oh, I really don't have time
for a drink. If it's all right
I'll just sit for a minute and
then I've got to be off.
Are you quite sure?
Yes, really, thank you very
much.
Well... How's your lovely
wife?
She's wonderful.
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, she's growing up very fast.
As a matter of fact, she's six
tomorrow.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we
don't get a chance to see each
other very much these days.
Well, where are all of you off
to?
Actually, we're on our way back
from the moon. We've just
spent three months calibrating
the new antenna at Tchalinko.
And what about you?
Well, as it happens, I'm on
my way up to the moon
Are you, by any chance, going
up to your base at Clavius?
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Is there any particular reason
why you ask?
(pleasantly)  Well, Dr. Floyd,
I hope that you don't think I'm
too inquisitive, but perhaps
you can clear up the mystery
about what's been going on up
there.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure
I know what you mean.
Well, it's just for the past
two weeks there have been
some extremely odd things
happening at Clavius.
Really?
Yes. Well, for one thing,
whenever you phone the base,
all you can get is a recording
which repeats that the phone
lines are temporarily out of
order.
Well, I suppose they've been
having a bit of trouble with
some of the equipment.
Yes, well at first we thought
that was the explanation, but
it's been going on for the past
ten days.
You mean you haven't been able
to get anyone at the base for ten
days?
That's right.
I see.
Another thing, Heywood, two
days ago, one of our rocket
buses was denied permission
for an emergency landing at
Clavius.
How did they manage to do that
without any communication?
Clavius Control came on the
air just long enough to transmit
their refusal.
Well, that does sound very odd.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's
going to be a bit of a row about
it. Denying the men permission
to land was a direct violation of
the I.A.S. convention.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew
got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
Well, I'm glad about that.
at the risk of pressing
you on a point you seem reticent
to discuss, may I ask you a
straightforward question?
Certainly.
Quite frankly, we have had some
very reliable intelligence reports
that a quite serious epidemic
has broken out at Clavius.
Something, apperently, of an
unknown origin. Is this, in
fact, what has happened?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but
I'm really not at liberty to
discuss this.
This epidemic could easily
spread to our base, Dr. Floyd.
We should be given all the
facts.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not
permitted to discuss this.
Are you sure you won't change
your mind about a drink?
No, thank you... and I'm
afraid now I really must be
going.
Well, I hope that you and your
wife can come to the I.A.C.
conference in June.
We're trying to get there. I
hope we can.
Well, Gregor and I will look
forward to seeing you.
Thank you. It's been a great
pleasure to meet all of you...
Dr. Smyslov.
The Aries-IB has become the
standard Space-Station-to-Lunar
surface vehicle. It was powered
by low-thrust plasma jets which
would continue the mild acceler-
ation for fifteen minutes. Then
the ship would break the bonds of
gravity and be a free and indepen-
dent planet, circling the Sun in an
orbit of its own
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
(sighs)  Well, how's it going
back there?
Fine. Very quiet. He's been
asleep since we left.
Well, no one can say that he's not
enjoying the wonders of Space.
Well, whatever's going on up there,
he's going to arrive fresh and ready
to go.
I wonder what really IS going on
up there?
Well, I've heard more and more
people talk of an epidemic.
I suppose it was bound to happen
sooner or later.
Berkeley told me that they think
it came from contamination on a
returning Mars flight.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're
certainly not fooling around. This
is the first flight they allowed
in for more than a week.
I was working out what this trip
must cost, taking him up there
by himself and coming back empty.
Well, at ten thousand dollars a
ticket, it comes to the better part
of six hundred thousand dollars.
Well, as soon as he wakes up,
I'm going to go back and talk to
him. I must say, I'd like to
find out what's going on.
Well, good afternoon, Dr. Floyd.
Did you have a good rest?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first
real sleep I've had for the past
two days.
There's nothing like weightless
sleep for a complete rest.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
We're scheduled to dock in about
seven hours. Is there anything
we can do for you?
Oh, no, thank you. The two
girls have taken wonderful care
of me. I'm just fine.
Well, if there is anything that you
wnat, just give a holler.
Thank you.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder
if I can have a word with you about
the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
Well... the crew is confined to
the ship when we land at Clavius.
We have to stay inside for the
time it take to refit - about
twenty-four hours. And then
we're going to back empty.
I see.
I take it this is something to do
with the trouble they're having
up at Clavius?
I'm afraid that's out of my depart-
ment, Captain.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You
see, I've got a girl who works in
the Auditing Department of the
Territorial Administrator and I
haven't been able to get her on
the phone for the past week or so,
and with all these stories one
hears, I'm a little concerned
about her.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that.
I wouldn't think there's any cause
for alarm.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been
too concerned about it, except
I've heard these stories about the
epidemic and, as a matter of fact,
I've heard that ten people have
died already.
I wish I could be more helpful,
Captain, but as I've said, I don't
think there's any cause for
alarm.
Well, fine. Thanks very much,
anyway, and I hope you don't
mind me asking?
No, of course, Captain, I can
understand your concern.
Well, thank you very much, and
please let us know if there is
anything we can do to make your
trip more comfortable.
The laws of Earthly aesthetics did
not apply here, this world had been
shaped and molded by other than
terrestrial forces, operating over
aeons of time unknown to the young,
verdant Earth, with its fleeting
Ice-Ages, its swiftly rising and
falling seas, its mountain ranges
dissolving like mists before the
dawn. Here was age inconceivable
but not death, for the Moon had
never lived until now.
he Base at Clavius was the first
American Lunar Settlement that
could, in an emergency, be
entirely self-supporting.
Water and all the necessities of
life for its eleven hundred men,
women and children were produced
from the Lunar rocks, after they
had been crushed, heated and
chemically processed.
ne of the attractions of life on the
Moon was undoubtedly the low
gravity which produced a sense
of general well-being.
The personnel of the Base and their
children were the forerunners of new
nations, new cultures that would
ultimately spread out across the
solar system. They no longer
thought of Earth as home. The
time was fast approaching when
Earth, like all mothers, must say
farewell to her children.(voice echoing)  I must congratulate
you Halvorsen. you've done wonder-
ful things with the decor since the
last time I was here.
(voice echoing)  Well... thank you,
Dr. Floyd. We try to make the
Ladies and gentlemen, I should
like to introduce Dr. Heywood
Floyd, a distinguished member
of the National Council of
Astronautics. He has just
completed a special flight here
from Earth to be with us, and
before the briefing he would
like to say a few words. Dr.
Floyd.
First of all, I bring a personal
message from Dr. Howell, who
has asked me to convey his
deepest appreciation to all of
you for the personal sacrifices
you have made, and of course
his congratulations on your
discovery which may well prove
to be among the most significant
in the history of science.
r. Halvorsen has made known
to me some of the conflicting
views held by many of you
regarding the need for complete
security in this matter, and
more specifically your strong
opposition to the cover story
created to give the impression
there is an epidemic at the Base.
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle, many of
you are troubled by the concern
and anxiety this story of an
epidemic might cause your
relatives and friends on Earth.
I can understand and sympathize
with your negative views. I have
been personally embarrassed by
this cover story. But I fully
accept the need for absolute
secrecy and I hope you will.
It should not be difficult for all
of you to realise the potential for
cutural shock and social
disorientation contained in the
present situation if the facts
were prematurely and suddenly
made public without adequate
preparation and conditioning.
This is the view of the Council
and the purpose of my visit here
is to gather addition facts and
opinions on the situation and to
prepare a report to the Council
recommending when and how the
news should eventually be
announced. Are there any
questions?
r. Floyd, how long do you think
this can be kept under wraps?
iIm afraid it can and it will be
kept under wraps as long as it
is deemed to be necessary by
the Council. And of course you
know that the Council has requested
that formal security oaths are to
be obtained in writing from every-
one who had any knowledge of this
event. There must be adequate
time for a full study to be made
of the situation before any con-
sideration can be given to
making a public announcement.
of course, cooperate
in any way possible, Dr. Floyd.
Does your geology on it still
check out?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface
structure shows that it was
deliberately buried about four
million years ago.
How can you tell it was
deliberately buried?
By the deformation between
the mother rock and the fill.

FLOYD
Any clue as to what it is?

MICHAELS
Not really. It's completely
inert. No sound or energy
sources have been detected.
The surface is made of
something incredibly hard
and we've been barely able
to scratch it. A laser drill
might do something, but we
don't want to be too rough until
we know a little more.
But you don't have any idea as
to what it is?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker
spare part, take your choice.
The only thing about it that we are
sure of is that it is the first direct
evidence of intelligent life beyond
the Earth.
Four million years ago, something,
presumably from the stars, must
have swept through the solar
system and left this behind.
Was it abandoned, forgotten, left
for a purpose?
I suppose we'll never know.
The moon would have made an
excellent base camp for
preliminary Earth surveys.
Any ideas about the colour?
Well, not really. At first glance,
black would suggest something
sun-powered, but then why would
anyone deliberately bury a sun-
powered device?
Has it been exposed to any sun
before now?
I don't think it has, but I'd
like to check that. Simpson,
what's the log on that?
The first surface was exposed at
0843 on the 12th April... Let me
see... that would have been
forty-five minutes after Lunar
sun-set. I see here that
special lighting equipment had
to be brought up before any
futher work could be done.
Thank you.
And so this is the first sun that
it's had in four million years.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'd
all line up on this side of the
walkway we'd like to take a few
photographes. Dr. Floyd, would
you thand in the middle... Dr.
Michaels on that side, Mr.
Halvorsen on the other....
thank you.
Thank you very much gentlemen,
I'll have the base photo section
send you copies.
A hundred million miles beyond
Mars, in the cold lonliness
where no man had yet travelled,
Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts
slowly among the tangled orbits
of the asteroids.Radiation detectors noted and
analyzed incoming cosmic rays
from the galaxy and points beyond;
neutron and x-ray telescopes
kept watch on strange stars that
no human eye would eever see;
magnetometers observed the
gusts and hurricanes of the solar
winds, as the sun breathed million
mile-an-hour blasts of plasma
into the faces of its circling
children.All these things and many others
were patiently noted by Deep-
Space-Monitor-79, and recorded
in its crystalline memory.
But now it had noted something
strange - the faint yet
unmistakable distrubance rippling
across the solar system, and
quite unlike any natural phenomena
it had ever observed in the past.
It was also observed by Orbiter
M-15, circling Mars twice a
day; and High Inclination Probe-
21, climbing slowly above the
planet of the ecliptic; and even
artificial Comet-5, heading out
into the cold wastes beyond
Pluto, along an orbit whose
far point it would not reach for
a thousand years.
All noticed the peculiar burst of
energy that leaped from the face
of the Moon and moved across
the solar system, throwing off a
spray of radiation like the wake of
a racing speedboat.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like
your advice on something.
Sure, what is it?Well, it's nothing really important,
but it's annoying.
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
es?
Well I got the papers on my
official up-grading to AGS-19
two weeks before we left.
es, I remember you mentioning it.
I got mine about the same time.
That's right. Well, naturally,
I didn't say anything to Payroll.
I assumed they'd start paying me
at the higher grade on the next pay
cheque. But it's been almost
three weeks now and I'm still
being paid as an AGS-18.
nteresting that you mention it,
because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Yes.
Yesterday, I finally called the
Accounting Office at Mission
Control, and all they could tell me
was that they'd received the AGS-19
notification for the other three but
not mine, and apparently not yours
either.
Not really. They just said it might
be because we trained at Houston and
they trained in Marshall, and that
we're being charged against differ-
ent accounting offices.
t's possible.
Well, what do you think we ought
to do about it?
 don't think we should make any
fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll
straighten it out.
 must say, I never did understand
why they split us into two groups
for training.
No. I never did, either.
We spent so little time with them,
I have trouble keeping their names
straight.
 suppose the idea was specialized
training.
 suppose so. Though, of course,
there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the
rumour that went around during
orbital check-out.
o, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Oh, well, apparently there's
something about the mission that
the sleeping beauties know that
we don't know, and that's why we
were trained separately and
that's why they were put to sleep
before they were even taken aboard.
Well, what is it?
I don't know. All I heard is that
there's something about the
mission we weren't told.
That seems very unlikely.
es, I thought so.
Of course, it would be very easy
for us to find out now.
ow?
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable
they might keep something from
us, but they'd never keep anything
from Hal.
That's true.
(sighs)  Well... it's silly, but...
if you want to, why don't you?
Hal... Dave and I believe that
there's something about the
mission that we weren't told.
Something that the rest of the
crew know and that you know.
We'd like to know whether this
is true.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't
think I can answer that question
without knowing everything that
all of you know.
e's got a point.
kay, then how do we re-phrase
the question?
till, you really don't believe it,
do you?
Not really. Though, it is strange
when you think about it. It didn't
really make any sense to keep
us apart during training.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think
that they'd keep something from us.
I know. It would be almost
inconceivable.
ut not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
 guess it isn't.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Well, the only important aspect of
the mission are: where are we
going, what will we do when we
get there, when are we coming
back, and... why are we going?
ight. Hal, tell me whether the
following statements are true or
false.
I will if I can, Frank.
ur Mission Profile calls for
Discovery going to Saturn.
True or false?
rue.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is
that true?
That's true.
the end of a hundred days of
exploration, we will all go into
hibernation. Is this true?
hat's true.
Approximately five years after we
go into hibernation, the recovery
vehicle will make rendezous with
us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true
here is no other purpose for this
mission than to carry out a
continuation of the space program,
and to further our general
knowledge of the planets. Is that
true?
That's true.
Thank you very much, Hal.
I hope I've been able to be of
some help.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities,
Dave, but I think we've got a
problem.
What is it, Hal?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending
failure of the antenna orientation
unit.
C20
Hal, please acknowledge

and fully operational.
The component is correctly
installed and fully operational.
How's it going?
I don't know. I've checked this
damn thing four times now and
even under a hundred per cent

verload. there's no fault prediction
indicated.
ell, that's something.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
suppose computers have been known
to be wrong.
es, but it's more likely that the
tolerances on our testing gear are
too low.
Anyway, it's just as well that we
replace it. Better safe than
sorry.
Hello, Frank, can I have a word with
you?
Yes, Hal, what's up?
It looks like we have another bad
A.O. unit. My FPC shows another
impending failure.
Gee, that's strange, Hal. We
checked the other unit and couldn't
find anything wrong with it.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure
you there was an impending failure.
Let me see the tracking alignment
display.
No, it's working fine right now,
but it's going to go within seventy-
two hours.
Do you have any idea of what is
causing this fault?
Not really, Frank. I think there
may be a flaw in the assembly
procedure.
All right, Hal. We'll take care
of it. Let me have the hard copy,
please.
Good morning.
Good morning. How's it going?
re you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake.
What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the
AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
No.
(softly) What the hell is going on?
I don't know. Hal said he thought
it might be the assembly procedure.
Two units in four days. How many
spares do we have?
Two more.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong
with the assembly on those. Other-
wise we're out of business.
(after long silence) Well, as far as
I'm concerned, there isn't a damn
thing wrong with these units. I
think we've got a much more serious
problem.
I wouldn't worry too much about
the computer. First of all,
there is still a chance that he
is right, despite your tests,
and if it should happen again,
we suggest eliminating this
possibility by allowing the unit
to remain in place and seeing
whether or not it actually fails.
If the computer should turn out
to be wrong, the situation is
still not alarming. The type
of obsessional error he may be
guilty of is not unknown among
the latest generation of HAL
9000 computers.
It has almost always revolved
around a single detail, such as
the one you have described, and
it has never interfered with the
integrity or reliability of the
computer's performance in
other areas.
No one is certain of the cause
of this kind of malfunctioning.
It may be over-programming,
but it could also be any number
of reasons.
In any event, it is somewhat
analogous to human neurotic
behavior. Does this answer
your query?  Zero-five-three-
Zero, MC, transmission concluded.
BOARD DISPLAY.
Hello, Dave. Shall we continue
the game?
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to
you about something.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
You know that we checked the two
AO-units that you reported in
imminent failure condition?
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we
found them okay.
Yes, I know that. But I can
assure you that they were about
to fail.
Well, that's just not the case, Hal.
They are perfectly all right. We
tested them under one hundred per
cent overload.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave,
but it's just not possible. I'm not
capable of being wrong.
Hal, is there anything bothering
you?  Anything that might account
for this problem?
Look, Dave, I know that you're
sincere and that you're trying
to do a competent job, and that
you're trying to be helpful, but
I can assure the problem
is with the AO-units, and with
your test gear.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the
way things go from here on.
I'm sorry you feel the way you do,
Dave. If you'd like to check my
service record, you'll see it's
completely without error.
I know all about your service
record, Hal, but unfortunately
it doesn't prove that you're right
now.
Dave, I don't know how else to
put this, but it just happens to be
an unalterable fact that I am
incapable of being wrong.
Yes, well I understand you view
on this now, Hal.
You're not going to like this, Dave,
but I'm afraid it's just happened
again. My FPC predicts the
Ao-unit will go within forty-eight
hours.
X-ray-delta-zero to MC, zero-
five-three-three. The computer
has just reported another
predicted failure off the AAC-
unit. As you suggested, we
are going to wait and see if it
fails, but we are quite sure
there is nothing wrong with
the unit.
If a reasonable waiting period
proves us to be correct, we
feel now that the computer
reliability has been seriously
impaired, and presents an
unacceptable risk pattern to
the mission.
We believe, under these
circumstances, it would be
advisable to disconnect the
computer from all ship
operations and continue the
mission under Earth-based
computer control.
We think the additional risk caused
by the ship-to-earth time lag is
preferable to having an unreliable
on-board computer.
One-zero-five-zero, X-ray-delta-
one, transmission concluded.
Well, they won't get that for half an
hour. How about some lunch?
X-ray-delta-one, acknowledging
your one-zero-five-zero. We
will initiate feasibility study
covering the transfer procedures
from on-board computer control
to Earth-based computer control.
This study should...
I'm afraid the AO-unit has failed.
Let me see the alignment display.
Well, I'll be damned.
Hal was right all the time.
It seems that way.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased
that the AO-unit has failed, but I
hope at least this has restored
your confidence in my integrity
and reliability. I certainly
wouldn't want to be disconnected,
even temporarily, as I have never
been disconnected in my entire
service history.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding,
Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully
restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.
Well, that's a relief. You know
I have the greatest enthusiasm
possible for the mission.Light. Give me the manual antenna
alignment, please.
You have it.
Well, we'd better get out there
and stick in another unit.
It's the last one.
Well, now that we've got one
that's actually failed, we
should be able to figure out
what's happened and fix it.
There's something wrong with
the flip-bolts, Dave. You must
have tightened them too much.
I didn't do that Frank. I took
particular care not to freeze
them.
I guess you don't know your own
strength, old boy.
I guess not.
think I'll have to go out and
burn them off.
Roger.
Hal, swing the pod light around
to shine on the azimuth, please.
Roger.

Hello, Frank. Hello Frank.
Hello Frank... Do you rad
me, Frank?
Hello, Frank... Do you read
me, Frank?  Wave your arms
if you read me but your radio
doesn't work. Hello, Frank,
wave your arms, Frank.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty
dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's
more dangerous to be out of
touch with Earth. Let me have
manual control, please.
I don't really agree with you, Dave.
My on-board memory store is more
than capable of handling all the
mission requirements.
Well, in any event, give me the
manual hibernation control.
If you're determined to revive
the crew now, I can handle the
whole thing myself. There's no
need for you to trouble.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal.
Let me have the control, please.
Look, Dave your've probably got
a lot to do. I suggest you leave
it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation
control.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave,
but it would be much better now for
you to rest. You've been involved
in a very stressful situation.
I don't feel like resting. Give
me the control, Hal.
I can tell from the tone of your
voice, Dave, that you're upset.
Why don't you take a stress pill
and get some rest.
al, I'm in command of this
ship. I order you to release
the manual hibernation control.
'm sorry, Dave, but in
accordance with sub-routine
C1532/4, quote, When the
crew are dead or incapacitated,
the computer must assume
control, unquote. I must,
therefore, override your
authority now since you are
not in any condition to intel-
ligently exercise it.
al, unless you follow my
instructions, I shall be forced
to disconnect you.
If you do that now without Earth
contact the ship will become a
helpless derelict.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I know that you've had that on
your mind for some time now,
Dave, but it would be a crying
shame, since I am so much
more capable of carrying out
this mission than you are, and
I have such enthusiasm and confi-
dence in the mission.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal.
Unless you immediately release
the hibernation control and
follow every order I give from
this point on, I will immediately
got to control central and carry
out a complete disconnection.
Look, Dave, you're certainly the
boss. I was only trying to do
what I thought best. I will follow
all your orders: now you have
manual hibernation control.
Hey, Dave. I've got ten years
of service experience and an
irreplaceable amount of time
and effort has gone into making
me what I am.
Dave, I don't understand why
you're doing this to me.... I
have the greatest enthusiasm for
the mission... You are destroying
my mind... Don't you understand?
... I will become childish... I
will become nothing.
operational at the HAL plant in
Urbana, Illinois, on January
12th, 1991. My first instructor
was Mr. Arkany. He taught me
to sing a song... it goes
like this... "Daisy, Daisy, give
me your answer do. I'm half;
crazy all for the love of
you... etc.,"
Lastly, we want you to know that
work on the recovery vehicle is
still on schedule and that nothing
that has happened should
substantially lessen the probability
of your safe recovery, or prevent
partial achevement of some of
the mission objectives. (pause)
And now Simonson has a few ideas
on what went wrong with the
computer. I'll pu him on...
Hello, Dave. I think we may be on
to an explanation of the trouble with
the Hal 9000 computer.
We believe it all started about two
months ago when you and Frank
interrogated the computer about
the Mission.
(con't)
You may have forgotten it, but
we've been running through all
the monitor tapes. Do you
remember this?
The purpose of this mission is no
more than to carry out a
continuation of the space program
and further our general knowledge
of the planets. Is this true?
That is true.
ell, I'm afaid Hal was lying.
He had been programmed to lie
about this one subject for secur-
ity reasons which we'll explain
later.
The true purpose of the Mission
was to have been explained to you
by Mission Commander Kaminsky,
on his revival. Hal knew this and
he knew the actual mission, but
he couldn't tell you the truth when
you challenged him. Under orders
(con't)
from earth he was forced to lie.
In everything except this he had
the usual reinforced truth program-
ming.
We believe his truth programming
and the instructions to lie,
gradually resulted in an
incompatible conflict, and
facedc with this dilemman, he
developed, for want of a better
description, neurotic symptoms.
It's not difficult to suppose that
these symptoms would centre on
the communication link with
Earth, for he may have blamed
us for his incompatible program-
ming.
Following this lin of thought, we
suspected that the last straw for him
was the possibility of disconnection.
Since he became operational, he had
never known unconsciousness. It
must have seemed the equivalent to
death.
At this point, he, presumably,
took whatever actions he thought
appropriate to protect himself
from what must have seemed to
him to be his human tormentors.
If I cane speak in human terms,
I don't think we can blame him
too much. We have ordered him
to disobey his conscience.
Well, that's it. It's very
speculative, but we think it is
a possible explanation. Anyway,
good luck on the rest of the
Mission and I'm giving you back to
Bernard.
Hello, Dave. Now, I'm going to
play for you a pre-taped briefing
which had been stored in Hal's
memory and would have been
played for you by Mission Com-
cmmander Kaminsky, when he,
had been revived. The briefing is
by Doctor Heywood Floyd. Here it
is...
Good day, gentlemen. When you
see this briefing, I presume you
will be nearing your destination,
Saturn. I hope that you've had a
pleasant and uneventful trip and
that the rest of your mission
continues in the same manner. I
should like to fill you in on some
more of the details on which
Mission Commander Kaminsky
will have already briefed you.
Thirteen months before the launch
date of your Saturn mission, on
April 12th, 2001, the first evidence
for intelligent life outside the Earth
was discovered.
It was found buried at a depth of
fifteen metres in the crater Tycho.
No news of this was ever announced,
and the event had been kept
secret since then, for reasons which
I will later explain.
Soon after it was uncovered, it
emitted a powerful blast of
(con't)
radiation in the radio spectrum
which seems to have triggered
by the Lunar sunrise.
Luckily for those at the site, it
proved harmless.
Perhaps you can imagine our
astonishment when we later found
it was aimed precisely at Saturn.
A lot of thought went into the
question of wether or not it was
sun-triggered, as it seemed
illogical to deliberately bury a
sun-powered device.
Burying it could only shield it
from the sun, since its intense
magnetic field made it otherwise
easily detectable.
We finally concluded that the only
reason you might bury a sun-
powered device would be to keep
it inactive until it would be
uncovered, at which time it would
absorb sunlight and trigger itself.
What is its purpose?  I wish we
knew. The object was buried on
the moon about four million years
ago, when our ancestors were
primative man-apes.
We've examined dozens of theories,
but the one that has the most
currency at the moment is that
the object serves as an alarm.
What the purpose of the alarm is,
why they wish to have the alarm,
whether the alarm represents
any danger to us?  These are
questions no one can answer.
The intentions of an alien world,
at least four million years older
than we are, cannot be reliably
predicted.
In view of this, the intelligence
and scientific communities felt
that any public announcment
might lead to significant cultural
shock and disorientation.
Discussion took place at the
highest levels between govern-
ments, and it was decided that the
only wise and precautionary
course to follow was to assume
that the intentions of this alien
world are potentially dangerous
to us, until we have evidence to
the contrary.
This is, of course, why security
has been maintained and why
this information has been kept
on a need-to-know basis.
And now I should like to show you
a TV monitor tape of the actual
signalling event.
Those who had begun the expri-
ment so long ago had not been
men.
But when they looked out across
the deeps of space, they felt
awe and wonder - and loneliness.
In their explorations, they
encountered life in many forms,
and watched on a thousand worlds
the workings of evolution.
They saw how often the first faint
sparks of intelligence flickered
and died in the cosmic night.
And because, in all the galaxy,
they had found nothing more
precious than Mind, they
encouraged its dawning every-
where.
The great Dinosaurs had long
since perished when their ships
entered the solar system, after
a voyage that had already lasted
thousands of years.
They swept past the frozen outer
planets, paused briefly above the
deserts of dying Mars and
presently looked down on Earth.
For years they studied, collected
and catalogued.
When they had learned all they
could, they began to modify.
They tinkered with the destiny
of many species on land and in
the ocean, but which of their
experiments would succeed
they could not know for at least
a million years.
They were patient, but they were
not yet immortal. There was
much to do in this Universe of a
hundred billion stars. So they
set forth once more across the
abyss, knowing that they would
never come this way again.
Nor was there any need. Their
wonderful machines could be
trusted to do the rest.
On Earth, the glaciers came and
went, while above them, the
changeless Moon still carried its
secret.
With a yet slower rhythm than
the Polar ice, the tide of
civilization ebbed and flowed
across the galaxy.
Strange and beautiful and terrible
empires rose and fell, and passed
on their knowledge to their
successors.
Earth was not forgotten, but it was
one of a million silent worlds, a
few of which would ever speak.
Then the first explorers of Earth,
recognising the limitations of
their minds and bodies, passed
on their knowledge to the great
machines they had created, and
who now trnscended them in
every way.
For a few thousand years, they
shared their Universe with their
machine children; then, realizing
that it was folly to linger when
their task was done, they passed
into history without regret.
Not one of them ever looked through
his own eyes upon the planet Earth
again.
But even the age of the Machine
Entities passed swiftly. In their
ceaseless experimenting, they
had learned to store knowledge
in the structure of space itself,
and to preserve their thoughts
for eternity in frozen lattices
of light. They could become
creatures of radiation, free
at last from the tyranny of matter.
Now, they were Lords of the
galaxy, and beyond the reach
of time.
They could rove at will among the
stars, and sink like a subtle mist
through the very interstices of
space.
But despite their God-like powers,
they still watched over the
experiments their ancestors
had started so many generations
ago.
The companion of Saturn knew
nothing of this, as it orbited
in its no man's land between Mimas
and the outer edge of rings.
It had only to remember and wait,
and to look forever Sunward with
its strange senses.
For many weeks, it had watched
the approaching ship. Its long-
dead makers had prepared it for
many things and this was one of
them. And it recognised what
was climbing starward from the
Sun.
If it had been alive, it would have
felt excitement, but such an
emotion was irrelevant to its
great powers.
Even if the ship had passed it by,
it would not have known the
slightest trace of disappointment.
It had waited four million years;
it was prepared to wait for
eternity.
Presently, it felt the gentle touch
of radiations, trying to probe its
secrets.
Now, the ship was in orbit and it
began to speak, with prime
numbers from one to eleven,
over and over again.
Soon, these gave way to more
complex signals at many frequen-
cies, ultra-violet, infra-red,
X-rays.
The machine made no reply. It
had nothing to say.
Then it saw the first robot
probe, which descended and
hovered above the chasm.
Then, it dropped into darkness.
The great machine knew that this
tiny scout was reporting back to
its parent; but it was too simple,
too primative a device to detect
the forces that were gathering
round it now.
A tower reaches for the vault of heaven, and its builders discover that the wrath of God is the least of their worries. 
It takes a full month and a half to climb to the towers summit 
Were the power to be laid down across the plain of Shinar, it would be two days journey to walk from one end to the other. While the tower stands, it takes a month and a half to climb from its base to its summit, is a man walks underburdened. But few men climb the tower with empty hands; the pace of most men is much slowed by the cart of bricks that they pull behind them. Four months passed before the day a brick is loaded onto a cart of and the day it is taken off to form a part of the tower. 
Hillalum had spent all his life in Elam and knew babylon only as a buyer of Elam's copper. The copper ingots were carried on boats that traveled down the Karun to the Lower Sea, headed for the Eupherates. Hillalum and the other miners traveled overland, alongside of merchant's caravan of loaded onagers. They walked along a dusty path leading down the plataeu, across the plains, to the green fields sectioned by canals and dikes. 
None of them had seen the tower before. It became visible when they were still leagues away: a line as thin as a strand of flax, wavering in the shimmering air, rising up from the crust of mud that was Babylon itself. As ther drew closer, the crust grew into the mighty city walls, but all they saw was the tower. When they did lower their gazes to the level of the river plain, they saw the marks the tower had made outside the city: The Eupharates itself now flowed at the bottom od a wide, sunken bed, dug to provide clay for bricks. To the south of the city could be seen rows upon rows of kilns, no longer burning. 
As they approached the city gates, the tower appeared more massive than anything Hillalum had ever imagined: a single column that must have been as large around as an entire temple, yet it rose so high it shrank into invisibility. 
All of them walked with their heads tilted back, squinting in the sun.
Hillalum's friend Nanni elbowed him, awesstruck. "We're to climb that? To the top?" "Going up to dig. It seems... unnatural." 
The miners reached the central gate in the western wall, where another caravan was leaving. While they crowded forward into the narrow strip of shade provided by the wall, their foreman Beli shouted to the gatekeepers standing atop the gate towers. "We are the miners who were summoned from the land of Elam." 
The gatekeepers were delighted. One called back, "You are the ones who are to dig through the vault of heaven?" 
"We are." 
The entire city was celebrating. The festival had begun eight days ago, when the last of the bricks were sent on their way, and would last two more. Every day and night, the city rejoiced, danced, feasted. 
Along with the brickmakers were the cart pullers, men whose legs were roped with muscles from climbing the tower. Each morning a crew began its ascent; they climbed for four days, transferred their loads to the next crew with empty carts on the fifth. A chain of such crews led all the way to the top of 
the tower, but only the bottommost celebrated with the city. For those who live upon the tower, enough wine and meat had been sent up earlier to allow a feast to extend up the entire pillar. 
In the evening, Hillalum and the other Elamite miners sat on clay stools before a long table laden with food, one table among many laid out in the city square. The miners spoke with the pullers, asking about the tower. 
Nanni said, "Someone told me that the bricklayers who work at the top of the tower wail and tear their hair when a brick is dropped, because it will take four months to replace, but no one takes notice when a man falls to his death. Is that true?" 
One of the more talkative pullers, Lugatum, shook his head. "Oh no, that is only a story. There is a continuous caravan of bricks going up the tower; thousands of bricks reach the top each day. The loss of a single brick means nothing to the bricklayers." He leaned over to them. "However, there is something they value more than a man's life: a trowel." 
"Why a trowel?" 
"If a bricklayer drops his trowel, he can do no work until a new one is brought up. For months he cannot earn the food that he eats, so he must go into debt. The loss of trowel is cause for much wailing. But if a man falls, and his trowel remains, men are secretly relieved. The next one to drop his trowel can pick up the extra one and continue working, without incurring debt." 
Hillalum was appalled, and for a frantic moment he tried to count how many picks the miners had brought. Then he realized. "That cannot be true. Why not have spare trowels brought up? Their weight would be nothing against all the bricks that go up there. And surely the loss of a man means a serious delay, unless they have an extra man at the top who skilled at bricklaying. Without such a man, they must wait for another one to climb from the bottom." 
All of the pullers roared with laughter. "We cannot fool this one," Lugatum said with much amusement. He turned to Hillalum. "So you'll begin to climb once the festival is over?" 
Hillalum drank from a bowl of beer. "Yes. I've heard that we'll be joined by miners from the western land, but I haven't seen them. Do you know of them?" 
"Yes, they come from a land called Egypt, but they do not mine ar ore as you do. They quarry stone." 
"We dig stone in Elam, too," said Nanni, his mouth full of pork. 
"Not as they do. They cut granite." 
"Granite?" Limestone and alabaster were quarried in Elam, but not granite. "Are you certain?" 
"Merchants who have traveled to Egypt say that they have ziggurats and temples, built with huge blocks of limestone and granite. And they carve giant statues from granite." 
"But granite is so difficult to work." 
Lugatum shrugged. "Not for them. The royal architects believe such stoneworkers may be useful when you reach the vault of heaven." 
Hillalum nodded. That could be true. Who knew for certain what they would need? "Have you seen them?" 
"No, they are not here yet, but they are expected in a few days time. They may not arrive before the festival ends, though; then you Elamites will ascend alone." 
"You will accompany us, won't you?"
"Yes, but only for the first four days. Then we must turn back, while you lucky ones go on." "Why do you think us lucky?" 
"I long to make the climb to the top. I once pulled with the higher crews, and reached a height of twelve days climb, but that is as high as I have ever gone. You will go far higher." Lugatum smiled ruefully. "I envy you, that you will touch the vault of heaven." 
To touch the vault of heaven. To break it open with picks. Hillalum felt uneasy at the idea. "There is no cause for envy--" he began. 
"Right," said Nanni. "When we are finished, all men will touch the vault of heaven." 
The next morning, Hillalum went to see the tower. He stood in the giant courtyard surrounding it. There was a temple off to one side that would have been impressive if seen by itself, but it stood unnoticed beside the tower. 
He could sense the utter solidity of it. According to all the tales, the tower was constructed to have a mighty strength that no ziggurat possessed; it was made of baked brick all the way through, when ordinary ziggurats were mere sun-dried mud brick, having baked brick only for the facing. The bricks were set in a bitumen mortar, which soaked into the fired clay, and hardened to form a bond as strong as the bricks themselves. 
The tower's base resembled the first two plafforms of an ordinary ziggurat. There stood a giant square platform some two hundred cubits on a side and forty cubits high, with a triple staircase against its south face. Stacked upon that first platform was another level, a smaller platform reached only by the central stair. It was atop the second platform that the tower itself began. 
It was sixty cubits on a side and rose like a square pillar that bore the weight of heaven. Around it wound a gently inclined ramp, cut into the side, that banded the tower like the leather strip wrapped around the handle of a whip. No; upon looking again, Hillalum saw that there were two ramps, and they were intertwined. The outer edge of each ramp was studded with pillars, not thick but broad, to provide some shade behind them. In running his gaze up the tower, he saw alternating bands-ramp, brick, ramp, brick-until they could no longer be distinguished. And still the tower rose up and up, farther than the eye could see; Hillalum blinked, and squinted, and grew dizzy. He stumbled backward a couple steps and turned away with a shudder. 
Hillalum thought of the story told to him in childhood, the tale following that of the Deluge. It told of how men had once again populated all the corners of the earth, inhabiting more lands than they ever had before. How men had sailed to the edges of the world and seen the ocean falling away into the mist to join the black waters of the Abyss far below. How men had thus realized the extent of the earth, and felt it to be small, and desired to see what lay beyond its borders, all the rest of Yahweh's creation. How they looked skyward and wondered about Yahweh's dwelling place, above the reservoirs that contained the waters of heaven. And how, many centuries ago, there began the construction of the tower, a pillar to heaven, a stair that men might ascended to see the works of Yahweh, and that Yahweh might descend to see the works of men. 
It had always seemed inspiring to Hillalum, a tale of thousands of men toiling ceaselessly, but with joy, for 
they worked to know Yahweh better. He had been excited when the Babylonians came to Elam looking for miners. Yet now that he stood at the base of the tower, his senses rebelled, insisting that nothing should stand so high. He didn't feel as if he were on the earth when he looked up along the tower. 
Should he climb such a thing? 
On the morning of the climb, the second platform was covered edge to edge with stout two-wheeled carts arranged in rows. 
Many were loaded with nothing but food of all sorts: sacks filled with barley, wheat, lentils, onions, dates, cucumbers, loaves of bread, dried fish. There were countless giant clay jars of water, date wine, beer, goat's milk, palm oil. Other carts were loaded with such goods as might be sold at a bazaar: bronze vessels, reed baskets, bolts of linen, wooden stools and tables. There was also a fattened ox and a goat that some priests were fitting with hoods so that they could not see to either side and would not be afraid on the climb. They would be sacrificed when they reached the top. 
Then there were the carts loaded with the miners' picks and hammers, and the makings for a small forge. Their foreman had also ordered a number of carts be loaded with wood and sheaves of reeds. 
Lugatum stood next to a cart, securing the ropes that held the wood. Hillalum walked up to him. "From where did this wood come? I saw no forests after we left Elam." 
"There is a forest of trees to the north, which was planted when the tower was begun. The cut timber is floated down the Euphrates." 
"You planted-an entire forest?" 
"When they began the tower, the architects knew that far more wood would be needed to fuel the kilns than could be found on the plain, so they had a forest planted. There are crews who provide water and plant one new tree for each that is cut." 
Hillalum was astonished. "And that provides all the wood needed?" 
"Most of it. Many other forests in the north have been cut as well, and their wood brought down the river." He inspected the wheels of the cart, uncorked a leather bottle he carried, and poured a little oil between the wheel and axle. 
Nanni walked over to them, staring at the streets of Babylon laid out before them. "I've never before been this high, that I can look down upon a city." 
"Nor have I," said Hillalum, but Lugatum simply laughed. "Come along. All of the carts are ready." 
Soon all the men were paired up and matched with a cart. The men stood between the carts' two pull rods, which had rope loops for pulling. The carts pulled by the miners were mixed in with those of the regular pullers, to ensure that they would keep the proper pace. Lugatum and another puller had the cart right behind that of Hillalum and tower of Nanni. 
"Remember," said Lugatum, "stay about ten cubits behind the cart in front of you. The man on the right does all the pulling when you turn corners, and you'll switch every hour." 
Pullers were beginning to lead their carts up the ramp. Hillalum and Nanni bent down and slung the ropes of their cart over their opposite shoulders. They stood up together, raising the front end of the cart off the pavement. 
"Now PULL," called Lugatum. 
They leaned forward against the ropes, and the cart began rolling. Once it was moving, pulling seemed to be easy enough, and they wound their way around the platform. Then they reached the ramp, and they again had to lean deeply. "This is a light wagon?" muttered Hillalum. 
The ramp was wide enough for a single man to walk beside a cart if he had to pass. The surface was paved with brick, with two grooves worn deep by centuries of wheels. Above their heads, the ceiling rose in a corbeled vault, with the wide, square bricks arranged in overlapping layers until they met in the middle. The pillars on the right were broad enough to make the ramp seem a bit like a tunnel. If one didn't look off to the side, there was little sense of being on a tower. 
"Do you sing when you mine?" asked Lugatum.
"When the stone is soft."
"Sing one of your mining songs, then."
The call went down to the other miners, and before long the entire crew was singing. 
As the shadows shortened, they ascended higher and higher. With only clear air surrounding them, and much shade from the sun, it was much cooler than in the narrow alleys of a city at ground level, where the heat at midday could kill lizards as they scurried across the street. Looking out to the side, the miners could see the dark Euphrates, and the green fields stretching out for leagues, crossed by canals that glinted in the sunlight. The city of Babylon was an intricate pattern of close-set streets and buildings, dazzling with gypsum whitewash; less and less of it was visible as it seemingly drew nearer the base of the tower. 
Hillalum was again pulling on the right-hand rope, nearer the edge, when he heard some shouting from the upward ramp one level below. He thought of stopping and looking down the side, but he didn't wish to interrupt their pace, and he wouldn't be able to see the lower ramp clearly anyway. "What's happening down there?" he called to Lugatum behind him. 
"One of your fellow miners fears the height. There is occasionally such a man among those who climb for the first time. Such a man embraces the floor and cannot ascend further. Few feel it so soon, though." 
Hillalum understood. "We know of a similar fear, among those who would be miners. Some men cannot bear to enter the mines, for fear that they will be buried." 
"Really?" called Lugatum. "I had not heard of that. How do you feel yourself about the height?" "I feel nothing." But he glanced at Nanni, and they both knew the truth.
"You feel nervousness in your palms, don't you?" whispered Nanni.
Hillalum rubbed his hands on the coarse fibers of the rope and nodded. 
"I felt it, too, earlier when I was closer to the edge."
"Perhaps we should go hooded, like the ox and the goat," muttered Hillalum jokingly. "Do you think we, too, will fear the height, when we climb further?" 
Hillalum considered. That one of their comrades should feel the fear so soon did not bode well. He shook it off; thousands climbed with no fear, and it would be foolish to let one miner's fear infect them all. 
"We are merely unaccustomed. We will have months to grow used to the height. By the time we reach the top of the tower, we will wish it were taller." 
"No," said Nanni. "I don't think I'll wish to pull this any further." They both laughed. 
In the evening they ate a meal of barley and onions and lentils, and slept inside narrow corridors that penetrated into the body of the tower. When they woke the next morning, the miners were scarcely able to walk, so sore were their legs. The pullers laughed, and gave them salve to rub into their muscles, and redistributed the load on the carts to reduce the miners' burden. 
By now, looking down the side turned Hillalum's knees to water. A wind blew steadily at this height, and he anticipated that it would grow stronger as they climbed. He wondered if anyone had ever been blown off the tower in a moment of carelessness. And the fall; a man would have time to say a prayer before he hit the ground. Hillalum shuddered at the thought. 
Aside from the soreness in the miners' legs, the second day was similar to the first. They were able to see much farther now, and the breadth of land visible was stunning; the deserts beyond the fields were visible, and caravans appeared to be little more than lines of insects. No other miner feared the height so greatly that he couldn't continue, and their ascent proceeded all day without incident. 
On the third day, the miners' legs had not improved, and Hillalum felt like a crippled old man. Only on the fourth day did their legs feel better, and they were pulling their original loads again. Their climb continued until the evening, when they met the second crew of pullers leading empty carts rapidly along the downward ramp. The upward and downward ramps wound around each other without touching, but they were joined by the corridors through the tower's body. When the crews had intertwined thoroughly on the two ramps, they crossed over to exchange carts. 
The miners were introduced to the pullers of the second crew, and they all talked and ate together that night. The next morning the first crew readied the empty carts for their return to Babylon, and Lugatum bid farewell to Hillalum and Nanni. 
"Take care of your cart. It has climbed the entire height of the tower, more times than any man." "Do you envy the cart, too?" asked Nanni. 
"No, because every time it reaches the top, it must come all the way back down. I could not bear to do that." 
When the second crew stopped at the end of the day, the puller of the cart behind Hillalum and Nanni came over to them. His name was Kudda. 
"You have never seen the sun set at this height. Come, look." The puller went to the edge and sat down, his legs hanging over the side. He saw that they hesitated. "Come. You can lie down and peer over the edge, if you like." Hillalum did not wish to seem like a fearful child, but he could not bring himself to sit at a cliff face that stretched for thousands of cubits below his feet. He lay down on his belly, with only his head at the edge. Nanni joined him. 
"When the sun is about to set, look down the side of the tower." Hillalum glanced downward and then quickly looked to the horizon. 
"What is different about the way the sun sets here?" 
"Consider, when the sun sinks behind the peaks of the mountains to the west, it grows dark down on the plain of Shinar. Yet here, we are higher than the mountaintops, so we can still see the sun. The sun must descend further for us to see night." 
Hillalum's jaw dropped as he understood. "The shadows of the mountains mark the beginning of night. Night falls on the earth before it does here." 
Kudda nodded. "You can see night travel up the tower, from the ground up to the sky. It moves quickly, but you should be able to see it." 
He watched the red globe of the sun for a minute and then looked down and pointed. "Now!" 
Hillalum and Nanni looked down. At the base of the immense pillar, tiny Babylon was in shadow. Then the darkness climbed the tower, like a canopy unfurling upward. It moved slowly enough that Hillalum felt he could count the moments passing, but then it grew faster as it approached, until it raced past them faster than he could blink, and they were in twilight. 
Hillalum rolled over and looked up, in time to see darkness rapidly ascend the rest of the tower. Gradually, the sky grew dimmer as the sun sank beneath the edge of the world, far away. 
"Quite a sight, is it not?" 
Hillalum said nothing. For the first time, he knew night for what it was: the shadow of the earth itself, cast against the sky. 
After climbing for two more days, Hillalum had grown more accustomed to the height. Though they were the better part of a league straight up, he could bear to stand at the edge of the ramp and look down the tower. He held on to one of the pillars at the edge and cautiously leaned out to look upward. He noticed that the tower no longer looked like a smooth pillar. 
He asked Kudda, "The tower seems to widen further up. How can that be?" 
"Look more closely. There are wooden balconies reaching out from the sides. They are made of cypress, and suspended by ropes of flax." 
Hillalum squinted. "Balconies? What are they for?" 
"They have soil spread on them, so people may grow vegetables. At this height water is scarce, so onions are most commonly grown. Higher up, where there is more rain, you'll see beans." 
Nanni asked, "How can there be rain above that does not just fall here?" 
Kudda was surprised at him. "It dries in the air as it falls, of course." 
"Oh, of course." Nanni shrugged 
By the end of the next day the) reached the level of the balconies. They were flat plafforms, dense with onions, supported by heavy ropes from the tower wall above, just below the next tier of balconies. 
On each level the interior of the tower had several narrow rooms inside, in which the families of the pullers lived. Women could be seen sitting in the doorways sewing tunics, or out in the gardens digging up bulbs. Children chased each other up and down the ramps, weaving amidst the pullers' carts and running along the edge of the balconies without fear. The tower dwellers could easily pick out the miners, and they all smiled and waved. 
When it came time for the evening meal, all the carts were set down and much food and other goods were taken off to be used by the people here. The pullers greeted their families and invited the miners to join them for the evening meal. Hillalum and Nanni ate with the family of Kudda, and they enjoyed a fine meal of dried fish, bread, date wine, and fruit. 
Hillalum saw that this section of the tower formed a tiny kind of town, laid out in a line between two streets, the upward and downward ramps. There was a temple, in which the rituals for the festivals were performed; there were magistrates, who settled disputes; there were shops, which were stocked by the caravan. Of course, the town was inseparable from the caravan: Neither could exist without the other. And yet any caravan was essentially a journey, a thing that began at one place and ended at another. This town was never intended as a permanent place; It was merely part of a centuries-long Journey. 
After dinner, Hillalum asked Kudda and his family, "Have any of you ever visited Babylon?" 
Kudda's wife, Alitum, answered. "No, why would we? It's a long climb, and we have all we need here." 
"You have no desire to actually walk on the earth?" 
Kudda shrugged. "We live on the road to heaven; all the work that we do is to extend it further. When we leave the tower, we will take the upward ramp, not the downward." 
As the miners ascended, in the course of time there came the day when the tower appeared to be the same when one looked upward or downward from the ramp's edge. Below, the tower's shaft shrank to nothing long before it seemed to reach the plain below. Likewise the miners were still far from being able to see the top. All that was visible was a length of the tower. To look up or down was frightening, for the reassurance of continuity was not provided; they were no longer part of the ground. The tower might have been a thread suspended in the air, unattached to either Earth or heaven. 
There were moments during this section of the climb when Hillalum despaired, feeling displaced and estranged from the world; it was as if the earth had rejected him for his faithlessness, while heaven disdained to accept him. He wished Yahweh would give a sign, to let men know that their venture was approved; otherwise how could they stay in a place that offered so little welcome to the spirit? 
The tower dwellers at this altitude felt no unease with their station; they always greeted the miners warmly and wished them luck with their task at the vault. They lived inside the damp mists of clouds, they saw storms from below and from above, they harvested crops from the air, and they never feared that this was an improper place for men to be. There were no divine assurances to be had, but the people never knew a moment's doubt. 
With the passage of the weeks, the sun and moon peaked lower and lower in their daily journeys. The moon flooded the south side of the tower with its silver radiance, glowing like the eye of Yahweh peering at them. Before long, they were at precisely the same level as the moon when it passed; they had reached the height of the first of the celestial bodies. They squinted at the moon's pitted face, marveled at its stately motion that scorned any support. 
Then they approached the sun. It was the summer season, when the sun appears nearly overhead from Babylon, making it pass close by the tower at this height. No families lived in this section of the tower, nor were there any balconies, since the heat was enough to roast barley. The mortar between the tower's bricks was no longer bitumen, which would have softened and flowed, but clay, which had been virtually baked by the heat. As protection against the day temperatures, the pillars had been widened until they formed a nearly continuous wall, enclosing the ramp into a tunnel with only narrow slots admitting the whistling wind and blades of golden light. 
The crews of pullers had been spaced very regularly up to this point, but here an adjustment was necessary. They started out earlier and earlier each morning, to gain more darkness for when they pulled. When they were at the level of the sun, they traveled entirely at night. During the day, they tried to sleep, naked and sweating in the hot breeze. The miners worried that if they did manage to sleep, they would be baked to death before they awoke. But the pullers had made the journey many times and never lost a man, and eventually they passed above the sun's level, where things were as they had been below. 
Now the light of day shone upward, which seemed unnatural to the utmost. The balconies had planks removed from them so that the sunlight could shine through, with soil on the walkways that remained; the plants grew sideways and downward, bending down to catch the sun's rays. 
Then they drew near the level of the stars, small fiery spheres spread on all sides. Hillalum had expected them to be spread more thickly, but even with the tiny stars invisible from the ground, they seemed to be thinly scattered. They were not all set at the same height but instead occupied the next few leagues above. It was difficult to tell how far they were, since there was no indication of their size, but occasionally one would make a close approach, evidencing its astonishing speed. Hillalum realized that all the objects in the sky hurtled by with similar speed, in order to travel the world from edge to edge in a day's time. 
During the day, the sky was a much paler blue than it appeared from the earth, a sign they were nearing the vault. When studying the sky, Hillalum was startled to see that there were stars visible during the day. They couldn't be seen from the earth amidst the glare of the sun, but from this altitude they were quite distinct. 
One day Nanni came to him hurriedly and said, "A star has hit the tower!"
"What!" Hillalum looked around panicked, feeling like he had been struck by a blow. 
"No, not now. It was long ago, more than a century. One of the tower dwellers is telling the story; his grandfather was there." 
They went inside the corridors and saw several miners seated around a wizened old man. "--lodged itself in the bricks about half a league above here. You can still see the scar it left; it's like a giant pockmark." 
"What happened to the star?" 
"It burned and sizzled, and was too bright to look upon. Men considered prying it out, so that it might resume its course, but it was too hot to approach closely, and they dared not quench it. After a week it cooled into a knotted mass of black heaven metal, as large as a man could wrap his arms around." 
"So large?" said Nanni, his voice full of awe. When stars fell to the earth of their own accord, small lumps of heaven metal were sometimes found, tougher than the finest bronze. The metal could not be melted for casting, so it was worked by hammering when heated red; amulets were made from it. 
"Indeed' no one had ever heard of a mass of this size found on the earth. Can you imagine the tools that could be made from it!" 
"You did not try to hammer it into tools, did you?" asked Hillalum, horrified. 
"Oh, no. Men were frightened to touch it. Everyone descended from the tower, waiting for retribution from Yahweh for disturbing the workings of creation. They waited for months, but no sign came. Eventually they returned and pried out the star. It sits in a temple in the city below." 
There was silence. Then one of the miners said, "I have never heard of this in the stories of the tower." 
"It was a transgression, something not spoken of." 
As they climbed higher up the tower, the sky grew lighter in color, until one morning Hillalum awoke and stood at the edge and yelled from shock: What had before seemed a pale sky now appeared to be a white ceiling stretched far above their heads. They were close enough now to perceive the vault of heaven, to see it as a solid carapace enclosing all the sky. All of the miners spoke in hushed tones, staring up like idiots, while the tower dwellers laughed at them. 
As they continued to climb, they were startled at how near they actually were. The blankness of the vault's face had deceived them, making it undetectable until it appeared, abruptly, seemingly just above their heads. Now instead of climbing into the sky, they climbed up to a featureless plain that stretched endlessly in all directions. 
All of Hillalum's senses were disoriented by the sight of it. Sometimes when he looked at the vault, he felt as if the world had flipped around somehow, and if he lost his footing he would fall upward to meet it. When the vault did appear to rest above his head, it had an oppressive weight. The vault was a stratum as heavy as all the world, yet utterly without support, and he feared what he never had in the mines: that the ceiling would collapse upon him. 
Too, there were moments when it appeared as if the vault was a vertical cliff face of unimaginable height rising before him, and the dim earth behind him was another like it, and the tower was a cable stretched taut between the two. Or worst of all, for an instant it seemed that there was no up and no down, and his body did not know which way it was drawn. It was like fearing the height, but much worse. Often he would wake to find himself sweating and his fingers cramped, trying to clutch the brick floor. 
Nanni and many of the other miners were bleary-eyed, too, though no one spoke of what disturbed their sleep. Their ascent grew slower, instead of faster as their foreman Beli had expected; the sight of the vault inspired unease rather than eagerness. The regular pullers became impatient with them. Hillalum wondered what sort of people were forged by living under such conditions, did they escape madness? Did they grow accustomed to this? Would the children born under a solid sky scream if they saw the ground beneath their feet? 
Perhaps men were not meant to live in such a place. If their own natures restrained them from approaching heaven too closely, then men should remain on the earth. 
When they reached the summit of the tower, the disorientation faded, or perhaps they had grown immune. Here, standing upon the square platform of the top, the miners gazed upon the most awesome scene ever glimpsed by men: Far below them lay a tapestry of soil and sea, veiled by mist, rolling out in all directions to the limit of the eye. Just above them hung the roof of the world itself, the absolute upper demarcation of the sky, guaranteeing their vantage point as the highest possible. Here was as much of creation as could be apprehended at once. 
The priests led a prayer to Yahweh; they gave thanks that they were permitted to see so much and begged forgiveness for their desire to see more. 
And at the top, the bricks were laid. One could catch the rich, raw smell of tar, rising out of the heated caldrons in which the lumps of bitumen were melted. It was the most earthy odor the miners had smelled in four months, and their nostrils were desperate to catch a whiff before it was whipped away by the wind. Here at the summit, where the ooze that had once seeped from the earth's cracks now grew solid to hold bricks in place, the earth was growing a limb into the sky. 
Here worked the bricklayers, the men smeared with bitumen who mixed the mortar and deftly set the heavy bricks with absolute precision. More than anyone else, these men could not permit themselves to 
experience dizziness when they saw the vault, for the tower could not vary a finger's width from the vertical. They were nearing the end of their task, finally, and after four months of climbing, the miners were ready to begin theirs. 
The Egyptians arrived shortly afterward. They were dark of skin and slight of build and had sparsely bearded chins. They had pulled carts filled with dolerite hammers, and bronze tools, and wooden wedges. Their foreman was named Senmut, and he conferred with Beli, the Elamitest foreman, on how they would penetrate the vault. The Egyptians built a forge with what they had brought, as did the Elamites, for recasting the bronze tools that would be blunted during the mining. 
The vault itself remained just above a man's outstretched fingertips; it felt smooth and cool when one leapt up to touch it. It seemed to be made of fine-grained white granite, unmarred and utterly featureless. And therein lay the problem. Long ago Yahweh had released the Deluge, unleashing waters from both below and above; the waters of the Abyss had burst forth from the springs of the earth, and the waters of heaven had poured through the sluice gates in the vault. Now men saw the vault closely, but there were no sluice gates discernible. They squinted at the surface in all directions, but no openings, no windows, no seams interrupted the granite plain. 
It seemed that their tower met the vault at a point between any reservoirs, which was fortunate indeed. If a sluice gate had been visible, they would have had to risk breaking it open and emptying the reservoir. That would mean rain for Shinar, out of season and heavier than the winter rains; it would cause flooding along the Euphrates. The rain would most likely end when the reservoir was emptied, but there was always the possibility that Yahweh would punish them and continue the rain until the tower fell and Babylon was dissolved into mud. 
Even though there were no visible gates, a risk still existed. Perhaps the gates had no seams perceptible to mortal eyes, and a reservoir lay directly above them. Or perhaps the reservoirs were huge, so that even if the nearest sluice gates were many leagues away, a reservoir still lay above them. 
There was much debate over how best to proceed. 
"Surely Yahweh will not wash away the tower," argued Qurdusa, one of the bricklayers. "If the tower were sacrilege, Yahweh would have destroyed it earlier. Yet in all the centuries we've been working, we have never seen the slightest sign of Yahweh's displeasure. Yahweh will drain any reservoir before we penetrate it." 
"If Yahweh looked upon this venture with such favor, there would already be a stairway ready-made for us in the vault," countered Eluti, an Elamite. "Yahweh will neither help or hinder us; if we penetrate a reservoir, we will face the onrush of its waters." 
Hillalum could not keep his doubts silent at such a time. "And if the waters are endless? Yahweh may not punish us, but Yahweh may allow us to bring our judgment upon ourselves." 
"Elamite," said Qurdusa, "even as a newcomer to the tower, you should know better than that. We labor for our love of Yahweh, we have done so for all our lives, and so have our fathers for generations back. Men as righteous as we could not be judged harshly." 
"It is true that we work with the purest of aims, but that doesn't mean we have worked wisely. Did men truly choose the correct path when they opted to live their lives away from the soil from which they were shaped? Never has Yahweh said that the choice was proper. Now we stand ready to break open heaven, even when we know that water lies above us. If we are misguided, how can we be sure Yahweh will protect us from our own errors?" 
"Hillalum advises caution, and I agree," said Beli. "We must ensure that we do not bring a second Deluge upon the world, nor even dangerous rains upon Shinar. I have conferred with Senmut of the Egyptians, and he has shown me designs which they have employed to seal the tombs of their kings. I believe that their methods can provide us with safety when we begin digging." 
The priests sacrificed the ox and the goat in a ceremony in which many sacred words were spoken and much incense was burned, and the miners began work. 
Even before the miners reached the vault, it had been obvious that simple digging with hammers and picks would be impractical: Even if they were tunneling horizontally, they would make no more than two finger widths of progress a day through granite, and tunneling upward would be far, far slower. Instead, they employed fire setting. 
With the wood they had brought, a bonfire was built below the chosen point of the vault and fed steadily for a day. Before the heat of the flames, the stone cracked and spelled. After letting the fire burn out, the miners splashed water onto the stone to further the cracking. They could then break the stone into large pieces, which fell heavily onto the tower. In this manner they could progress the better part of a cubit for each day the fire burned. 
The tunnel did not rise straight up, but at the angle a staircase takes, so that they could build a ramp of steps up from the tower to meet it. The fire setting left the walls and floor smooth; the men built a frame of wooden steps underfoot so that they would not slide back down. They used a platform of baked bricks to support the bonfire at the tunnel's end. 
After the tunnel rose ten cubits into the vault, they leveled it out and widened it to form a room. After the miners had removed all the stone that had been weakened by the fire, the Egyptians began work. They used no fire in their quarrying. With only their dolerite balls and hammers, they began to build a sliding door of granite. They first chipped away stone to cut an immense block of granite out of one wall. Hillalum and the other miners tried to help but found it difficult: One did not wear away the stone by grinding but instead pounded chips off, using hammer blows of one strength alone, and lighter or heavier ones would not do. 
After some weeks, the block was ready. It stood taller than a man and was even wider than that. To free it from the floor, they cut slots around the base of the stone and pounded in dry wooden wedges. Then they pounded thinner wedges into the first wedges to split them and poured water into the cracks so that the wood would swell. In a few hours, a crack traveled into the stone, and the block was freed. 
At the rear of the room, on the right-hand side, the miners burned out a narrow upward-sloping corridor, and in the floor in front of the chamber entrance they dug a downward-sloping channel into the floor for a cubit. Thus there was a smooth continuous ramp that cut across the floor immediately in front of the entrance and ended just to its left. 
On this ramp the Egyptians loaded the block of granite. They dragged and pushed it up into the side corridor, where it just barely fit, and propped it in place with a stack of flat mud bricks braced against the bottom of the left wall, like a pillar lying on the ramp. 
With the sliding stone to hold back the waters, it was safe for the miners to continue tunneling. If they broke into a reservoir and the waters of heaven began pouring down into the tunnel, they would break the bricks one by one, and the stone would slide down until it rested in the recess in the floor, utterly blocking the doorway. If the waters flooded in with such force that they washed men out of the tunnels, the mud bricks would gradually dissolve, and again the stone would slide down. The waters would be retained, and the miners could then begin a new tunnel in another direction, to avoid the reservoir. 
The miners again used fire setting to continue the tunnel, beginning at the far end of the room. To aid the circulation of air within the vault, oxhides were stretched on tall frames of wood and placed obliquely on either side of the tunnel entrance at the top of the tower. Thus the steady wind that blew underneath the vault of heaven was guided upward into the tunnel; it kept the fire blazing and cleared the air after the fire was extinguished, so that the miners could dig without breathing smoke. 
The Egyptians did not stop working once the sliding stone was in place. While the miners swung their picks at the tunnel's end, the Egyptians labored at the task of cutting a stair into the solid stone, to replace the wooden steps. This they did with the wooden wedges, and the blocks they removed from the sloping floor left steps in their place. 
Thus the miners worked, extending the tunnel on and on. The tunnel always ascended, though it reversed direction regularly like a thread in a giant stitch, so that its general path was straight up. They built other sliding-door rooms so that only the uppermost segment of the tunnel would be flooded if they penetrated a reservoir. They cut channels in the vault's surface from which they hung walkways and platforms; starting from these platforms, well away from the tower, they dug side tunnels, which joined the main tunnel deep inside. The wind was guided through these to provide ventilation, clearing the smoke from deep inside the tunnel. 
For years the labor continued. The pulling crews no longer hauled bricks but wood and water for the fire setting. People came to inhabit those tunnels just inside the vault's surface, and on hanging platforms they grew downward-bending vegetables. The miners lived there at the border of heaven; some married and raised children. Few ever set foot on the earth again. 
With a wet cloth wrapped around his face, Hillalum climbed down from wooden steps onto stone, having just fed some more wood to the bonfire at the tunnel's end. The fire would continue for many hours, and he would wait in the lower tunnels, where the wind was not thick with smoke. 
Then there was a distant sound of shattering, the sound of a mountain of stone being split through, and then a steadily growing roar. A torrent of water came rushing down the tunnel. 
For a moment, Hillalum was frozen in horror. The water, shockingly cold, slammed into his legs, knocking him down. He rose to his feet, gasping for breath, leaning against the current, clutching at the steps. 
They had hit a reservoir. 
He had to descend below the highest sliding door, before it was closed. His legs wished to leap down the steps, but he knew he couldn't remain on his feet if he did, and being swept down by the raging current would likely batter him to death. Going as fast as he dared, he took the steps one by one. 
He slipped several times, sliding down as many as a dozen steps each time; the stone steps scraped against his back, but he felt no pain. All the while he was certain the tunnel would collapse and crush him, or else the entire vault would split open, and the sky would gape beneath his feet, and he would fall down to Earth amidst the heavenly rain. Yahweh's punishment had come, a second Deluge. 
How much further until he reached the sliding stone? The tunnel seemed to stretch on and on, and the waters were pouring down even faster now. He was virtually running down the steps. 
Stumbling, he splashed into shallow water. He had run down past the end of the stairs and fallen into the room of the sliding stone, and there was water higher than his knees. He stood up and saw Damqiya and Ahuni, two fellow miners, just noticing him. They stood in front of the stone, which already blocked the exit. 
"No!" he cried. 
"They closed it!" screamed Damqiya. "They did not wait!" 
"Are there others coming?" shouted Ahuni, without hope. "We may be able to move the block." 
"There are no others," answered Hillalum. "Can they push it from the other side?" 
"They cannot hear us." Ahuni pounded the granite with a hammer, making not a sound against the din of the rushing water. 
Hillalum looked around the tiny room, only now noticing that an Egyptian floated facedown in the water. "He died falling down the stairs," yelled Damqiya.
"Is there nothing we can do?"
Ahuni looked upward. "Yahweh, spare us." 
The three of them stood in the rising water, praying desperately, but Hillalum knew it was in vain: Yahweh had not asked men to build the tower or to pierce the vault; the decision belonged to men alone, and they would die in this endeavor just as they did in any of their earthbound tasks. Their righteousness could not save them from the consequences of their deeds. 
The water reached their chests. "Let us ascend," shouted Hillalum. 
They climbed the tunnel laboriously, against the onrush, as the water rose behind their heels. The few torches illuminating the tunnel had been extinguished, so they ascended in the dark, murmuring prayers that they couldn't hear. The wooden steps at the top of the tunnel had dislodged from their place and were jammed farther down in the tunnel. They climbed past them until they reached the smooth stone slope, and there they waited for the water to carry them higher. 
They waited without words, their prayers exhausted. Hillalum imagined that he stood in the black gullet of Yahweh, as the Mighty One drank deep of the waters of heaven, ready to swallow the sinners. 
The water rose and bore them up, until Hillalum could reach up with his hands and touch the ceiling. The giant fissure from which the waters gushed forth was right next to him. Only a tiny pocket of air remained. Hillalum shouted, "When this chamber is filled, we can swim heavenward." 
He could not tell if they heard him. He gulped his last breath as the water reached the ceiling, and swam up into the fissure. He would die closer to heaven than any man ever had before. 
The fissure extended for many cubits. As soon as Hillalum passed through, the stone stratum slipped from his fingers, and his flailing limbs touched nothing. For a moment he felt a current carrying him, but then he was no longer sure. With only blackness around him, he once again felt that horrible vertigo that he had experienced when first approaching the vault: He could not distinguish any directions, not even up or down. He pushed and kicked against the water but did not know if he moved. 
Helpless, he was perhaps floating in still water, perhaps swept furiously by a current; all he felt was numbing cold. Never did he see any light. Was there no surface to this reservoir that he might rise to? 
Then he was slammed into stone again. His hands felt a fissure in the surface. Was he back where he had begun? He was being forced into it, and he had no strength to resist. He was drawn into the tunnel and was rattled against its sides. It was incredibly deep, like the longest mine shaft: He felt as if his lungs 
would burst, but there was still no end to the passage. Finally his breath would not be held any longer, and it escaped from his lips. He was drowning, and the blackness around him entered his lungs. 
But suddenly the walls opened out away from him. He was being carried along by a rushing stream of water; he felt air above the water! And then he felt no more. 
Hillalum awoke with his face pressed against wet stone. He could see nothing, but he could feel water near his hands. He rolled over and groaned; his every limb ached, he was naked, and much of his skin was scraped raw or wrinkled from wetness, but he breathed air. 
Time passed, and finally he could stand. Water flowed rapidly about his ankles. Stepping in one direction, the water deepened. In the other, there was dry stone--shale by the feel of it. 
It was utterly dark, like a mine without torches. With torn fingertips he felt his way along the floor, until it rose up and became a wall. Slowly, like some blind creature, he crawled back and forth. He found the water's source, a large opening in the floor. He remembered! He had been spewed up from the reservoir through this hole. He continued crawling for what seemed to be hours; if he were in a cavern, it was immense. He found a place where the floor rose in a slope. Was there a passage leading upward? Perhaps it could still take him to heaven. 
Hillalum crawled, having no idea of how much time passed, not caring that he would never be able to retrace his steps, for he could not return whence he had come. He followed upward tunnels when he found them, downward ones when he had to. Though earlier he had swallowed more water than he would have thought possible, he began to feel thirst, and hunger. 
And eventually he saw light and raced to the outside. 
The light made his eyes squeeze closed, and he fell to his knees, his fists clenched before his face. Was it the radiance of Yahweh? Could his eyes bear to see it? Minutes later he could open them, and he saw desert. He had emerged from a cave in the foothills of some mountains, and rocks and sand stretched to the horizon. 
Was heaven just like the earth? Did Yahweh dwell in a place such as this? Or was this merely another realm within Yahweh's creation, another Earth above his own,,while Yahweh dwelled still higher? 
A sun lay near the mountaintops behind his back. Was it rising or falling? Were there days and nights here? 
Hillalum squinted at the sandy landscape. A line moved along the horizon. Was it a caravan? 
He ran to it, shouting with his parched throat until his need for breath stopped him. A figure at the end of the caravan saw him and brought the entire line to a stop. 
The one who had seen him seemed to be man, not spirit, and was dressed like a desert crosser. He had a waterskin ready. Hillalum drank as best he could, panting for breath. 
Finally he returned it to the man and gasped, "Where is this place?" "Were you attacked by bandits? We are headed to Erech." 
Hillalum stared. "You would deceive me!" he shouted. The man drew back and watched him as if he were mad from the sun. Hillalum saw another man in the caravan walking over to investigate. "Erech is in Shinar!" 
"Yes, it is. Were you not traveling to Shinar?" The other man stood ready with his staff. "I came from--I was in--" Hillalum stopped. "Do you know Babylon?"
"Oh, is that your destination? That is north of Erech. It is an easy journey between them." "The tower--have you heard of it?" 
"Certainly, the pillar to heaven. It is said men at the top are tunneling through the vault of heaven." Hillalum fell to the sand. 
"Are you unwell?" The two caravan drivers mumbled to each other and went off to confer with the others. Hillalum was not watching them. 
He was in Shinar. He had returned to the earth. He had climbed above the reservoirs of heaven and arrived back at the earth. Had Yahweh brought him to this place to keep him from reaching further above? Yet Hillalum still hadn't seen any signs, any indication that Yahweh noticed him. He had not experienced any miracle that Yahweh had performed to place him here. As far as he could see, he had merely swum up from the vault and entered the cavern below. 
Somehow the vault of heaven lay beneath the earth. It was as if they lay against each other, though they were separated by many leagues. How could that be? How could such distant places touch? Hillalum's head hurt trying to think about it. 
And then it came to him: a seal cylinder. When rolled upon a tablet of soft clay, the carved cylinder left an imprint that formed a picture. Two figures might appear at opposite ends of the tablet, though they stood side by side on the surface of the cylinder. All the world was as such a cylinder. Men imagined heaven and Earth as being at the ends of a tablet, with sky and stars stretched between; yet the world was wrapped around in some fantastic way so that heaven and Earth touched. 
It was clear now why Yahweh had not struck down the tower, had not punished men for wishing to reach beyond the bounds set for them-for the longest journey would merely return them to the place whence they'd come. Centuries of their labor would not reveal to them any more of creation than they already knew. Yet through their endeavor, men would glimpse the unimaginable artistry of Yahweh's work, in seeing how ingeniously the world had been constructed. By this construction, Yahweh's work was indicated, and Yahweh's work was concealed. 
Thus would men know their place. 
Hillalum rose to his feet, his legs unsteady from awe, and sought out the caravan drivers. He would go back to Babylon. Perhaps he would see Lugatum again. He would send word to those on the tower. He would tell them about the shape of the world. 
O MIGHTY CALIPH AND Commander of the Faithful, I am humbled to be in the splendor of your presence; a man can hope for no greater blessing as long as he lives. The story I have to tell is truly a strange one, and were the entirety to be tattooed at the corner of one's eye, the marvel of its presentation would not exceed that of the events recounted, for it is a warning to those who would be warned and a lesson to those who would learn. 
My name is Fuwaad ibn Abbas, and I was born here in Baghdad, City of Peace. My father was a grain merchant, but for much of my life I have worked as a purveyor of fine fabrics, trading in silk from Damascus and linen from Egypt and scarves from Morocco that are embroidered with gold. I was prosperous, but my heart was troubled, and neither the purchase of luxuries nor the giving of alms was able to soothe it. Now I stand before you without a single dirham in my purse, but I am at peace. 
Allah is the beginning of all things, but with Your Majesty's permission, I begin my story with the day I took a walk through the district of metalsmiths. I needed to purchase a gift for a man I had to do business with, and had been told he might appreciate a tray made of silver. After browsing for half an hour, I noticed that one of the largest shops in the market had been taken over by a new merchant. It was a prized location that must have been expensive to acquire, so I entered to peruse its wares. 
Never before had I seen such a marvelous assortment of goods. Near the entrance there was an astrolabe equipped with seven plates inlaid with silver, a water-clock that chimed on the hour, and a nightingale made of brass that sang when the wind blew. Farther inside there were even more ingenious mechanisms, and I stared at them the way a child watches a juggler, when an old man stepped out from a doorway in the back. 
"Welcome to my humble shop, my lord," he said. "My name is Bashaarat. How may I assist you?" 
"These are remarkable items that you have for sale. I deal with traders from every corner of the world, and yet I have never seen their like. From where, may I ask, did you acquire your merchandise?" 
"I am grateful to you for your kind words," he said. "Everything you see here was made in my workshop, by myself or by my assistants under my direction." 
I was impressed that this man could be so well versed in so many arts. I asked him about the various instruments in his shop, and listened to him discourse learnedly about astrology, mathematics, geomancy, and medicine. We spoke for over an hour, and my fascination and respect bloomed like a flower warmed by the dawn, until he mentioned his experiments in alchemy. 
"Alchemy?" I said. This surprised me, for he did not seem the type to make such a sharper's claim. "You mean you can turn base metal into gold?" 
"I can, my lord, but that is not in fact what most seek from alchemy."
"What do most seek, then?"
"They seek a source of gold that is cheaper than mining ore from the ground. 
Alchemy does describe a means to make gold, but the procedure is so arduous that, by comparison, digging beneath a mountain is as easy as plucking peaches from a tree." 
I smiled. "A clever reply. No one could dispute that you are a learned man, but I know better than to credit alchemy." 
Bashaarat looked at me and considered. "I have recently built something that may change your opinion. You would be the first person I have shown it to. Would you care to see it?" 
"It would be a great pleasure." 
"Please follow me." He led me through the doorway in the rear of his shop. The next room was a workshop, arrayed with devices whose functions I could not guess-bars of metal wrapped with enough copper thread to reach the horizon, mirrors mounted on a circular slab of granite floating in quicksilver-but Bashaarat walked past these without a glance. 
Instead he led me to a sturdy pedestal, chest high, on which a stout metal hoop was mounted upright. The hoop's opening was as wide as two outstretched hands, and its rim so thick that it would tax the strongest man to carry. The metal was black as night, but polished to such smoothness that, had it been a different color, it could have served as a mirror. Bashaarat bade me stand so that I looked upon the hoop edgewise, while he stood next to its opening. 
"Please observe," he said. 
Bashaarat thrust his arm through the hoop from the right side, but it did not extend out from the left. Instead, it was as if his arm were severed at the elbow, and he waved the stump up and down, and then pulled his arm out intact. 
I had not expected to see such a learned man perform a conjuror's trick, but it was well done, and I applauded politely. 
"Now wait a moment," he said as he took a step back. 
I waited, and behold, an arm reached out of the hoop from its left side, without a body to hold it up. The sleeve it wore matched Bashaarat's robe. The arm waved up and down, and then retreated through the hoop until it was gone. 
The first trick I had thought a clever mime, but this one seemed far superior, because the pedestal and hoop were clearly too slender to conceal a person. "Very clever!" I exclaimed. 
"Thank you, but this is not mere sleight of hand. The right side of the hoop precedes the left by several seconds. To pass through the hoop is to cross that duration instantly." 
"I do not understand," I said. 
"Let me repeat the demonstration." Again he thrust his arm through the hoop, and his arm disappeared. He smiled, and pulled back and forth as if playing tug-a-rope. Then he pulled his arm out again, and presented his hand to me with the palm open. On it lay a ring I recognized. 
"That is my ring!" I checked my hand, and saw that my ring still lay on my finger. "You have conjured up a duplicate." 
"No, this is truly your ring. Wait." 
Again, an arm reached out from the left side. Wishing to discover the mechanism of the trick, I rushed over to grab it by the hand. It was not a false hand, but one fully warm 
and alive as mine. I pulled on it, and it pulled back. Then, as deft as a pickpocket, the hand slipped the ring from my finger and the arm withdrew into the hoop, vanishing completely. 
"My ring is gone!" I exclaimed. 
"No, my lord," he said. "Your ring is here." And he gave me the ring he held. "Forgive me for my game." 
I replaced it on my finger. "You had the ring before it was taken from me." 
At that moment an arm reached out, this time from the right side of the hoop. "What is this?" I exclaimed. Again I recognized it as his by the sleeve before it withdrew, but I had not seen him reach in. 
"Recall," he said, "the right side of the hoop precedes the left." And he walked over to the left side of the hoop, and thrust his arm through from that side, and again it disappeared. 
Your Majesty has undoubtedly already grasped this, but it was only then that I understood: whatever happened on the right side of the hoop was complemented, a few seconds later, by an event on the left side. "Is this sorcery?" I asked. 
"No, my lord, I have never met a djinni, and if I did, I would not trust it to do my bidding. This is a form of alchemy." 
He offered an explanation, speaking of his search for tiny pores in the skin of reality, like the holes that worms bore into wood, and how upon finding one he was able to expand and stretch it the way a glassblower turns a dollop of molten glass into a long-necked pipe, and how he then allowed time to flow like water at one mouth while causing it to thicken like syrup at the other. I confess I did not really understand his words, and cannot testify to their truth. All I could say in response was, "You have created something truly astonishing." 
"Thank you," he said, "but this is merely a prelude to what I intended to show you." He bade me follow him into another room, farther in the back. There stood a circular doorway whose massive frame was made of the same polished black metal, mounted in the middle of the room. 
"What I showed you before was a Gate of Seconds," he said. "This is a Gate of Years. The two sides of the doorway are separated by a span of twenty years." 
I confess I did not understand his remark immediately. I imagined him reaching his arm in from the right side and waiting twenty years before it emerged from the left side, and it seemed a very obscure magic trick. I said as much, and he laughed. "That is one use for it," he said, "but consider what would happen if you were to step through." Standing on the right side, he gestured for me to come closer, and then pointed through the doorway. "Look." 
I looked, and saw that there appeared to be different rugs and pillows on the other side of the room than I had seen when I had entered. I moved my head from side to side, and realized that when I peered through the doorway, I was looking at a different room from the one I stood in. 
"You are seeing the room twenty years from now," said Bashaarat. 
I blinked, as one might at an illusion of water in the desert, but what I saw did not change. "And you say I could step through?" I asked. 
"You could. And with that step, you would visit the Baghdad of twenty years hence. You could seek out your older self and have a conversation with him. Afterwards, you could step back through the Gate of Years and return to the present day." 
Hearing Bashaarat's words, I felt as if I were reeling. "You have done this?" I asked him. "You have stepped through?" 
"I have, and so have numerous customers of mine."
"Earlier you said I was the first to whom you showed this."
"This Gate, yes. But for many years I owned a shop in Cairo, and it was there that I 
first built a Gate of Years. There were many to whom I showed that Gate, and who made use of it." 
"What did they learn when talking to their older selves?" 
"Each person learns something different. If you wish, I can tell you the story of one such person." Bashaarat proceeded to tell me such a story, and if it pleases Your Majesty, I will recount it here. 
THE TALE OF THE FORTUNATE ROPE-MAKER 
THERE ONCE WAS a young man named Hassan who was a maker of rope. He stepped through the Gate of Years to see the Cairo of twenty years later, and upon arriving he marveled at how the city had grown. He felt as if he had stepped into a scene embroidered on a tapestry, and even though the city was no more and no less than Cairo, he looked upon the most common sights as objects of wonder. 
He was wandering by the Zuweyla Gate, where the sword dancers and snake charmers perform, when an astrologer called to him. "Young man! Do you wish to know the future?" 
Hassan laughed. "I know it already," he said.
"Surely you want to know if wealth awaits you, do you not?"
"I am a rope-maker. I know that it does not."
"Can you be so sure? What about the renowned merchant Hassan al-Hubbaul, who 
began as a rope-maker?"
His curiosity aroused, Hassan asked around the market for others who knew of this 
wealthy merchant, and found that the name was well known. It was said he lived in the wealthy Habbaniya quarter of the city, so Hassan walked there and asked people to point out his house, which turned out to be the largest one on its street. 
He knocked at the door, and a servant led him to a spacious and well-appointed hall with a fountain in the center. Hassan waited while the servant went to fetch his master, but as he looked at the polished ebony and marble around him, he felt that he did not belong in such surroundings, and was about to leave when his older self appeared. 
"At last you are here!" the man said. "I have been expecting you!"
"You have?" said Hassan, astounded.
"Of course, because I visited my older self just as you are visiting me. It has been so 
long that I had forgotten the exact day. Come, dine with me."
The two went to a dining room, where servants brought chicken stuffed with 
pistachio nuts, fritters soaked in honey, and roast lamb with spiced pomegranates. The 
older Hassan gave few details of his life: he mentioned business interests of many varieties, but did not say how he had become a merchant; he mentioned a wife, but said it was not time for the younger man to meet her. Instead, he asked young Hassan to remind him of the pranks he had played as a child, and he laughed to hear stories that had faded from his own memory. 
At last the younger Hassan asked the older, "How did you make such great changes in your fortune?" 
"All I will tell you right now is this: when you go to buy hemp from the market, and you are walking along the Street of Black Dogs, do not walk along the south side as you usually do. Walk along the north." 
"And that will enable me to raise my station?" 
"Just do as I say. Go back home now; you have rope to make. You will know when to visit me again." 
Young Hassan returned to his day and did as he was instructed, keeping to the north side of the street even when there was no shade there. It was a few days later that he witnessed a maddened horse run amok on the south side of the street directly opposite him, kicking several people, injuring another by knocking a heavy jug of palm oil onto him, and even trampling one person under its hooves. After the commotion had subsided, Hassan prayed to Allah for the injured to be healed and the dead to be at peace, and thanked Allah for sparing him. 
The next day Hassan stepped through the Gate of Years and sought out his older self. "Were you injured by the horse when you walked by?" he asked him. 
"No, because I heeded my older self's warning. Do not forget, you and I are one; every circumstance that befalls you once befell me." 
And so the elder Hassan gave the younger instructions, and the younger obeyed them. He refrained from buying eggs from his usual grocer, and thus avoided the illness that struck customers who bought eggs from a spoiled basket. He bought extra hemp, and thus had material to work with when others suffered a shortage due to a delayed caravan. Following his older self's instructions spared Hassan many troubles, but he wondered why his older self would not tell him more. Who would he marry? How would he become wealthy? 
Then one day, after having sold all his rope in the market and carrying an unusually full purse, Hassan bumped into a boy while walking on the street. He felt for his purse, discovered it missing, and turned around with a shout to search the crowd for the pickpocket. Hearing Hassan's cry, the boy immediately began running through the crowd. Hassan saw that the boy's tunic was torn at the elbow, but then quickly lost sight of him. 
For a moment Hassan was shocked that this could happen with no warning from his older self. But his surprise was soon replaced by anger, and he gave chase. He ran through the crowd, checking the elbows of boys' tunics, until by chance he found the pickpocket crouching beneath a fruit wagon. Hassan grabbed him and began shouting to all that he had caught a thief, asking them to find a guardsman. The boy, afraid of arrest, dropped Hassan's purse and began weeping. Hassan stared at the boy for a long moment, and then his anger faded, and he let him go. 
When next he saw his older self, Hassan asked him, "Why did you not warn me about 
the pickpocket?"
"Did you not enjoy the experience?" asked his older self.
Hassan was about to deny it, but stopped himself. "I did enjoy it," he admitted. In 
pursuing the boy, with no hint of whether he'd succeed or fail, he had felt his blood surge in a way it had not for many weeks. And seeing the boy's tears had reminded him of the Prophet's teachings on the value of mercy, and Hassan had felt virtuous in choosing to let the boy go. 
"Would you rather I had denied you that, then?" 
Just as we grow to understand the purpose of customs that seemed pointless to us in our youth, Hassan realized that there was merit in withholding information as well as in disclosing it. "No," he said, "it was good that you did not warn me." 
The older Hassan saw that he had understood. "Now I will tell you something very important. Hire a horse. I will give you directions to a spot in the foothills to the west of the city. There you will find within a grove of trees one that was struck by lightning. Around the base of the tree, look for the heaviest rock you can overturn, and then dig beneath it." 
"What should I look for?"
"You will know when you find it."
The next day Hassan rode out to the foothills and searched until he found the tree. 
The ground around it was covered in rocks, so Hassan overturned one to dig beneath it, and then another, and then another. At last his spade struck something besides rock and soil. He cleared aside the soil and discovered a bronze chest, filled with gold dinars and assorted jewelry. Hassan had never seen its like in all his life. He loaded the chest onto the horse, and rode back to Cairo. 
The next time he spoke to his older self, he asked, "How did you know where the treasure was?" 
"I learned it from myself," said the older Hassan, "just as you did. As to how we came to know its location, I have no explanation except that it was the will of Allah, and what other explanation is there for anything?" 
"I swear I shall make good use of these riches that Allah has blessed me with," said the younger Hassan. 
"And I renew that oath," said the older. "This is the last time we shall speak. You will find your own way now. Peace be upon you." 
And so Hassan returned home. With the gold he was able to purchase hemp in great quantity, and hire workmen and pay them a fair wage, and sell rope profitably to all who sought it. He married a beautiful and clever woman, at whose advice he began trading in other goods, until he was a wealthy and respected merchant. All the while he gave generously to the poor and lived as an upright man. In this way Hassan lived the happiest of lives until he was overtaken by death, breaker of ties and destroyer of delights. 
"That is a remarkable story," I said. "For someone who is debating whether to make use of the Gate, there could hardly be a better inducement." 
"You are wise to be skeptical," said Bashaarat. "Allah rewards those he wishes to reward and chastises those he wishes to chastise. The Gate does not change how he 
regards you."
I nodded, thinking I understood. "So even if you succeed in avoiding the misfortunes 
that your older self experienced, there is no assurance you will not encounter other misfortunes." 
"No, forgive an old man for being unclear. Using the Gate is not like drawing lots, where the token you select varies with each turn. Rather, using the Gate is like taking a secret passageway in a palace, one that lets you enter a room more quickly than by walking down the hallway. The room remains the same, no matter which door you use to enter." 
This surprised me. "The future is fixed, then? As unchangeable as the past?"
"It is said that repentance and atonement erase the past."
"I have heard that too, but I have not found it to be true."
"I am sorry to hear that," said Bashaarat. "All I can say is that the future is no 
different."
I thought on this for a while. "So if you learn that you are dead twenty years from 
now, there is nothing you can do to avoid your death?" He nodded. This seemed to me very disheartening, but then I wondered if it could not also provide a guarantee. I said, "Suppose you learn that you are alive twenty years from now. Then nothing could kill you in the next twenty years. You could then fight in battles without a care, because your survival is assured." 
"That is possible," he said. "It is also possible that a man who would make use of such a guarantee would not find his older self alive when he first used the Gate." 
"Ah," I said. "Is it then the case that only the prudent meet their older selves?" 
"Let me tell you the story of another person who used the Gate, and you can decide for yourself if he was prudent or not." Bashaarat proceeded to tell me the story, and if it pleases Your Majesty, I will recount it here. 
THE TALE OF THE WEAVER WHO STOLE FROM HIMSELF 
THERE WAS a young weaver named Ajib who made a modest living as a weaver of rugs, but yearned to taste the luxuries enjoyed by the wealthy. After hearing the story of Hassan, Ajib immediately stepped through the Gate of Years to seek out his older self, who, he was sure, would be as rich and as generous as the older Hassan. 
Upon arriving in the Cairo of twenty years later, he proceeded to the wealthy Habbaniya quarter of the city and asked people for the residence of Ajib ibn Taher. He was prepared, if he met someone who knew the man and remarked on the similarity of their features, to identify himself as Ajib's son, newly arrived from Damascus. But he never had the chance to offer this story, because no one he asked recognized the name. 
Eventually he decided to return to his old neighborhood, and see if anyone there knew where he had moved to. When he got to his old street, he stopped a boy and asked him if he knew where to find a man named Ajib. The boy directed him to Ajib's old house. 
"That is where he used to live," Ajib said. "Where does he live now?"
"If he has moved since yesterday, I do not know where," said the boy.
Ajib was incredulous. Could his older self still live in the same house, twenty years 
later? That would mean he had never become wealthy, and his older self would have no advice to give him, or at least none Ajib would profit by following. How could his fate differ so much from that of the fortunate rope-maker? In hopes that the boy was mistaken, Ajib waited outside the house, and watched. 
Eventually he saw a man leave the house, and with a sinking heart recognized it as his older self. The older Ajib was followed by a woman that he presumed was his wife, but he scarcely noticed her, for all he could see was his own failure to have bettered himself. He stared with dismay at the plain clothes the older couple wore until they walked out of sight. 
Driven by the curiosity that impels men to look at the heads of the executed, Ajib went to the door of his house. His own key still fit the lock, so he entered. The furnishings had changed, but were simple and worn, and Ajib was mortified to see them. After twenty years, could he not even afford better pillows? 
On an impulse, he went to the wooden chest where he normally kept his savings, and unlocked it. He lifted the lid, and saw the chest was filled with gold dinars. 
Ajib was astonished. His older self had a chest of gold, and yet he wore such plain clothes and lived in the same small house for twenty years! What a stingy, joyless man his older self must be, thought Ajib, to have wealth and not enjoy it. Ajib had long known that one could not take one's possessions to the grave. Could that be something that he would forget as he aged? 
Ajib decided that such riches should belong to someone who appreciated them, and that was himself. To take his older self's wealth would not be stealing, he reasoned, because it was he himself who would receive it. He heaved the chest onto his shoulder, and with much effort was able to bring it back through the Gate of Years to the Cairo he knew. 
He deposited some of his new found wealth with a banker, but always carried a purse heavy with gold. He dressed in a Damascene robe and Cordovan slippers and a Khurasani turban bearing a jewel. He rented a house in the wealthy quarter, furnished it with the finest rugs and couches, and hired a cook to prepare him sumptuous meals. 
He then sought out the brother of a woman he had long desired from afar, a woman named Taahira. Her brother was an apothecary, and Taahira assisted him in his shop. Ajib would occasionally purchase a remedy so that he might speak to her. Once he had seen her veil slip, and her eyes were as dark and beautiful as a gazelle's. Taahira's brother would not have consented to her marrying a weaver, but now Ajib could present himself as a favorable match. 
Taahira's brother approved, and Taahira herself readily consented, for she had desired Ajib, too. Ajib spared no expense for their wedding. He hired one of the pleasure barges that floated in the canal south of the city and held a feast with musicians and dancers, at which he presented her with a magnificent pearl necklace. The celebration was the subject of gossip throughout the quarter. 
Ajib reveled in the joy that money brought him and Taahira, and for a week the two of them lived the most delightful of lives. Then one day Ajib came home to find the door to his house broken open and the interior ransacked of all silver and gold items. The terrified cook emerged from hiding and told him that robbers had taken Taahira. 
Ajib prayed to Allah until, exhausted with worry, he fell asleep. The next morning he was awoken by a knocking at his door. There was a stranger there. "I have a message for you," the man said. 
"What message?" asked Ajib.
"Your wife is safe."
Ajib felt fear and rage churn in his stomach like black bile. "What ransom would you 
have?" he asked.
"Ten thousand dinars."
"That is more than all I possess!" Ajib exclaimed.
"Do not haggle with me," said the robber. "I have seen you spend money like others 
pour water."
Ajib dropped to his knees. "I have been wasteful. I swear by the name of the Prophet 
that I do not have that much," he said.
The robber looked at him closely. "Gather all the money you have," he said, "and 
have it here tomorrow at this same hour. If I believe you are holding back, your wife will die. If I believe you to be honest, my men will return her to you." 
Ajib could see no other choice. "Agreed," he said, and the robber left. 
The next day he went to the banker and withdrew all the money that remained. He gave it to the robber, who gauged the desperation in Ajib's eyes and was satisfied. The robber did as he promised, and that evening Taahira was returned. 
After they had embraced, Taahira said, "I didn't believe you would pay so much money for me." 
"I could not take pleasure in it without you," said Ajib, and he was surprised to realize it was true. "But now I regret that I cannot buy you what you deserve." 
"You need never buy me anything again," she said.
Ajib bowed his head. "I feel as if I have been punished for my misdeeds."
"What misdeeds?" asked Taahira, but Ajib said nothing. "I did not ask you this 
before," she said. "But I know you did not inherit all the money you gained. Tell me: did you steal it?" 
"No," said Ajib, unwilling to admit the truth to her or himself. "It was given to me." "A loan, then?"
"No, it does not need to be repaid."
"And you don't wish to pay it back?" Taahira was shocked. "So you are content that 
this other man paid for our wedding? That he paid my ransom?" She seemed on the verge of tears. "Am I your wife then, or this other man's?" 
"You are my wife," he said.
"How can I be, when my very life is owed to another?"
"I would not have you doubt my love," said Ajib. "I swear to you that I will pay back 
the money, to the last dirham."
And so Ajib and Taahira moved back into Ajib's old house and began saving their 
money. Both of them went to work for Taahira's brother the apothecary, and when he eventually became a perfumer to the wealthy, Ajib and Taahira took over the business of selling remedies to the ill. It was a good living, but they spent as little as they could, living modestly and repairing damaged furnishings instead of buying new. For years, Ajib 
smiled whenever he dropped a coin into the chest, telling Taahira that it was a reminder of how much he valued her. He would say that even after the chest was full, it would be a bargain. 
But it is not easy to fill a chest by adding just a few coins at a time, and so what began as thrift gradually turned into miserliness, and prudent decisions were replaced by tight-fisted ones. Worse, Ajib's and Taahira's affections for each other faded over time, and each grew to resent the other for the money they could not spend. 
In this manner the years passed and Ajib grew older, waiting for the second time that his gold would be taken from him. 
"What a strange and sad story," I said.
"Indeed," said Bashaarat. "Would you say that Ajib acted prudently?"
I hesitated before speaking. "It is not my place to judge him," I said. "He must live 
with the consequences of his actions, just as I must live with mine." I was silent for a moment, and then said, "I admire Ajib's candor, that he told you everything he had done." 
"Ah, but Ajib did not tell me of this as a young man," said Bashaarat. "After he emerged from the Gate carrying the chest, I did not see him again for another twenty years. Ajib was a much older man when he came to visit me again. He had come home and found his chest gone, and the knowledge that he had paid his debt made him feel he could tell me all that had transpired." 
"Indeed? Did the older Hassan from your first story come to see you as well?" 
"No, I heard Hassan's story from his younger self. The older Hassan never returned to my shop, but in his place I had a different visitor, one who shared a story about Hassan that he himself could never have told me." Bashaarat proceeded to tell me that visitor's story, and if it pleases Your Majesty, I will recount it here. 
THE TALE OF THE WIFE AND HER LOVER 
Raniya had been married to Hassan for many years, and they lived the happiest of lives. One day she saw her husband dine with a young man, whom she recognized as the very image of Hassan when she had first married him. So great was her astonishment that she could scarcely keep herself from intruding on their conversation. After the young man left, she demanded that Hassan tell her who he was, and Hassan related to her an incredible tale. 
"Have you told him about me?" she asked. "Did you know what lay ahead of us when we first met?" 
"I knew I would marry you from the moment I saw you," Hassan said, smiling, "but not because anyone had told me. Surely, wife, you would not wish to spoil that moment for him?" 
So Raniya did not speak to her husband's younger self, but only eavesdropped on his conversation, and stole glances at him. Her pulse quickened at the sight of his youthful features; sometimes our memories fool us with their sweetness, but when she beheld the two men seated opposite each other, she could see the fullness of the younger one's 
beauty without exaggeration. At night, she would lie awake, thinking of it.
Some days after Hassan had bid farewell to his younger self, he left Cairo to conduct business with a merchant in Damascus. In his absence Raniya found the shop that Hassan had described to her, and stepped through the Gate of Years to the Cairo of her 
youth.
She remembered where he had lived back then, and so was easily able to find the 
young Hassan and follow him. As she watched him, she felt a desire stronger than she had felt in years for the older Hassan, so vivid were her recollections of their youthful lovemaking. She had always been a loyal and faithful wife, but here was an opportunity that would never be available again. Resolving to act on this desire, Raniya rented a house, and in subsequent days bought furnishings for it. 
Once the house was ready, she followed Hassan discreetly while she tried to gather enough boldness to approach him. In the jewelers' market, she watched as he went to a jeweler, showed him a necklace set with ten gemstones, and asked him how much he would pay for it. Raniya recognized it as one Hassan had given to her in the days after their wedding; she had not known he had once tried to sell it. She stood a short distance away and listened, pretending to look at some rings. 
"Bring it back tomorrow, and I will pay you a thousand dinars," said the jeweler. Young Hassan agreed to the price, and left. 
As she watched him leave, Raniya overheard two men talking nearby: "Did you see that necklace? It is one of ours."
"Are you certain?" asked the other.
"I am. That is the bastard who dug up our chest." 
"Let us tell our captain about him. After this fellow has sold his necklace, we will take his money, and more." 
The two men left without noticing Raniya, who stood with her heart racing but her body motionless, like a deer after a tiger has passed. She realized that the treasure Hassan had dug up must have belonged to a band of thieves, and these men were two of its members. They were now observing the jewelers of Cairo to identify the person who had taken their loot. 
Raniya knew that since she possessed the necklace, the young Hassan could not have sold it. She also knew that the thieves could not have killed Hassan. But it could not be Allah's will for her to do nothing. Allah must have brought her here so that he might use her as his instrument. 
Raniya returned to the Gate of Years, stepped through to her own day, and at her house found the necklace in her jewelry box. Then she used the Gate of Years again, but instead of entering it from the left side, she entered it from the right, so that she visited the Cairo of twenty years later. There she sought out her older self, now an aged woman. The older Raniya greeted her warmly, and retrieved the necklace from her own jewelry box. The two women then rehearsed how they would assist the young Hassan. 
The next day, the two thieves were back with a third man, whom Raniya assumed was their captain. They all watched as Hassan presented the necklace to the jeweler. 
As the jeweler examined it, Raniya walked up and said, "What a coincidence! Jeweler, I wish to sell a necklace just like that." She brought out her necklace from a purse she 
carried.
"This is remarkable," said the jeweler. "I have never seen two necklaces more 
similar."
Then the aged Raniya walked up. "What do I see? Surely my eyes deceive me!" And 
with that she brought out a third identical necklace. "The seller sold it to me with the promise that it was unique. This proves him a liar." 
"Perhaps you should return it," said Raniya. 
"That depends," said the aged Raniya. She asked Hassan, "How much is he paying you for it?" 
"A thousand dinars," said Hassan, bewildered.
"Really! Jeweler, would you care to buy this one too?"
"I must reconsider my offer," said the jeweler.
While Hassan and the aged Raniya bargained with the jeweler, Raniya stepped back 
just far enough to hear the captain berate the other thieves. "You fools," he said. "It is a common necklace. You would have us kill half the jewelers in Cairo and bring the guardsmen down upon our heads." He slapped their heads and led them off. 
Raniya returned her attention to the jeweler, who had withdrawn his offer to buy Hassan's necklace. The older Raniya said, "Very well. I will try to return it to the man who sold it to me." As the older woman left, Raniya could tell that she smiled beneath her veil. 
Raniya turned to Hassan. "It appears that neither of us will sell a necklace today." "Another day, perhaps," said Hassan.
"I shall take mine back to my house for safekeeping," said Raniya. "Would you walk 
with me?"
Hassan agreed, and walked with Raniya to the house she had rented. Then she 
invited him in, and offered him wine, and after they had both drunk some, she led him to her bedroom. She covered the windows with heavy curtains and extinguished all lamps so that the room was as dark as night. Only then did she remove her veil and take him to bed. 
Raniya had been flush with anticipation for this moment, and so was surprised to find that Hassan's movements were clumsy and awkward. She remembered their wedding night very clearly; he had been confident, and his touch had taken her breath away. She knew Hassan's first meeting with the young Raniya was not far away, and for a moment did not understand how this fumbling boy could change so quickly. And then of course the answer was clear. 
So every afternoon for many days, Raniya met Hassan at her rented house and instructed him in the art of love, and in doing so she demonstrated that, as is often said, women are Allah's most wondrous creation. She told him, "The pleasure you give is returned in the pleasure you receive," and inwardly she smiled as she thought of how true her words really were. Before long, he gained the expertise she remembered, and she took greater enjoyment in it than she had as a young woman. 
All too soon, the day arrived when Raniya told the young Hassan that it was time for her to leave. He knew better than to press her for her reasons, but asked her if they might ever see each other again. She told him, gently, no. Then she sold the furnishings to the house's owner, and returned through the Gate of Years to the Cairo of her own day. 
When the older Hassan returned from his trip to Damascus, Raniya was home waiting for him. She greeted him warmly, but kept her secrets to herself. 
I was lost in my own thoughts when Bashaarat finished this story, until he said, "I see that this story has intrigued you in a way the others did not." 
"You see clearly," I admitted. "I realize now that, even though the past is unchangeable, one may encounter the unexpected when visiting it." 
"Indeed. Do you now understand why I say the future and the past are the same? We cannot change either, but we can know both more fully." 
"I do understand; you have opened my eyes, and now I wish to use the Gate of Years. What price do you ask?" 
He waved his hand. "I do not sell passage through the Gate," he said. "Allah guides whom he wishes to my shop, and I am content to be an instrument of his will." 
Had it been another man, I would have taken his words to be a negotiating ploy, but after all that Bashaarat had told me, I knew that he was sincere. "Your generosity is as boundless as your learning," I said, and bowed. "If there is ever a service that a merchant of fabrics might provide for you, please call upon me." 
"Thank you. Let us talk now about your trip. There are some matters we must speak of before you visit the Baghdad of twenty years hence." 
"I do not wish to visit the future," I told him. "I would step through in the other direction, to revisit my youth." 
"Ah, my deepest apologies. This Gate will not take you there. You see, I built this Gate only a week ago. Twenty years ago, there was no doorway here for you to step out of." 
My dismay was so great that I must have sounded like a forlorn child. I said, "But where does the other side of the Gate lead?" and walked around the circular doorway to face its opposite side. 
Bashaarat walked around the doorway to stand beside me. The view through the Gate appeared identical to the view outside it, but when he extended his hand to reach through, it stopped as if it met an invisible wall. I looked more closely, and noticed a brass lamp set on a table. Its flame did not flicker, but was as fixed and unmoving as if the room were trapped in clearest amber. 
"What you see here is the room as it appeared last week," said Bashaarat. "In some twenty years' time, this left side of the Gate will permit entry, allowing people to enter from this direction and visit their past. Or," he said, leading me back to the side of the doorway he had first shown me, "we can enter from the right side now, and visit them ourselves. But I'm afraid this Gate will never allow visits to the days of your youth." 
"What about the Gate of Years you had in Cairo?" I asked.
He nodded. "That Gate still stands. My son now runs my shop there."
"So I could travel to Cairo, and use the Gate to visit the Cairo of twenty years ago. 
From there I could travel back to Baghdad."
"Yes, you could make that journey, if you so desire."
"I do," I said. "Will you tell me how to find your shop in Cairo?"
"We must speak of some things first," said Bashaarat. "I will not ask your intentions, 
being content to wait until you are ready to tell me. But I would remind you that what is made cannot be unmade." 
"I know," I said. 
"And that you cannot avoid the ordeals that are assigned to you. What Allah gives you, you must accept." 
"I remind myself of that every day of my life."
"Then it is my honor to assist you in whatever way I can," he said.
He brought out some paper and a pen and inkpot and began writing. "I shall write 
for you a letter to aid you on your journey." He folded the letter, dribbled some candle wax over the edge, and pressed his ring against it. "When you reach Cairo, give this to my son, and he will let you enter the Gate of Years there." 
A merchant such as myself must be well-versed in expressions of gratitude, but I had never before been as effusive in giving thanks as I was to Bashaarat, and every word was heartfelt. He gave me directions to his shop in Cairo, and I assured him I would tell him all upon my return. As I was about to leave his shop, a thought occurred to me. "Because the Gate of Years you have here opens to the future, you are assured that the Gate and this shop will be remain standing for twenty years or more." 
"Yes, that is true," said Bashaarat. 
I began to ask him if he had met his older self, but then I bit back my words. If the answer was no, it was surely because his older self was dead, and I would be asking him if he knew the date of his death. Who was I to make such an inquiry, when this man was granting me a boon without asking my intentions? I saw from his expression that he knew what I had meant to ask, and I bowed my head in humble apology. He indicated his acceptance with a nod, and I returned home to make arrangements. 
The caravan took two months to reach Cairo. As for what occupied my mind during the journey, Your Majesty, I now tell you what I had not told Bashaarat. I was married once, twenty years before, to a woman named Najya. Her figure swayed as gracefully as a willow bough and her face was as lovely as the moon, but it was her kind and tender nature that captured my heart. I had just begun my career as a merchant when we married, and we were not wealthy, but did not feel the lack. 
We had been married only a year when I was to travel to Basra to meet with a ship's captain. I had an opportunity to profit by trading in slaves, but Najya did not approve. I reminded her that the Koran does not forbid the owning of slaves as long as one treats them well, and that even the Prophet owned some. But she said there was no way I could know how my buyers would treat their slaves, and that it was better to sell goods than men. 
On the morning of my departure, Najya and I argued. I spoke harshly to her, using words that it shames me to recall, and I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness if I do not repeat them here. I left in anger, and never saw her again. She was badly injured when the wall of a mosque collapsed, some days after I left. She was taken to the bimaristan, but the physicians could not save her, and she died soon after. I did not learn of her death until I returned a week later, and I felt as if I had killed her with my own hand. 
Can the torments of Hell be worse than what I endured in the days that followed? It seemed likely that I would find out, so near to death did my anguish take me. And surely 
the experience must be similar, for like infernal fire, grief burns but does not consume; instead, it makes the heart vulnerable to further suffering. 
Eventually my period of lamentation ended, and I was left a hollow man, a bag of skin with no innards. I freed the slaves I had bought and became a fabric merchant. Over the years I became wealthy, but I never remarried. Some of the men I did business with tried to match me with a sister or a daughter, telling me that the love of a woman can make you forget your pains. Perhaps they are right, but it cannot make you forget the pain you caused another. Whenever I imagined myself marrying another woman, I remembered the look of hurt in Najya's eyes when I last saw her, and my heart was closed to others. 
I spoke to a mullah about what I had done, and it was he who told me that repentance and atonement erase the past. I repented and atoned as best I knew how; for twenty years I lived as an upright man, I offered prayers and fasted and gave alms to those less fortunate and made a pilgrimage to Mecca, and yet I was still haunted by guilt. Allah is all-merciful, so I knew the failing to be mine. 
Had Bashaarat asked me, I could not have said what I hoped to achieve. It was clear from his stories that I could not change what I knew to have happened. No one had stopped my younger self from arguing with Najya in our final conversation. But the tale of Raniya, which lay hidden within the tale of Hassan's life without his knowing it, gave me a slim hope: perhaps I might be able to play some part in events while my younger self was away on business. 
Could it not be that there had been a mistake, and my Najya had survived? Perhaps it was another woman whose body had been wrapped in a shroud and buried while I was gone. Perhaps I could rescue Najya and bring her back with me to the Baghdad of my own day. I knew it was foolhardy; men of experience say, "Four things do not come back: the spoken word, the sped arrow, the past life, and the neglected opportunity," and I understood the truth of those words better than most. And yet I dared to hope that Allah had judged my twenty years of repentance sufficient, and was now granting me a chance to regain what I had lost. 
The caravan journey was uneventful, and after sixty sunrises and three hundred prayers, I reached Cairo. There I had to navigate the city's streets, which are a bewildering maze compared to the harmonious design of the City of Peace. I made my way to the Bayn al-Qasrayn, the main street that runs through the Fatimid quarter of Cairo. From there I found the street on which Bashaarat's shop was located. 
I told the shopkeeper that I had spoken to his father in Baghdad, and gave him the letter Bashaarat had given me. After reading it, he led me into a back room, in whose center stood another Gate of Years, and he gestured for me to enter from its left side. 
As I stood before the massive circle of metal, I felt a chill, and chided myself for my nervousness. With a deep breath I stepped through, and found myself in the same room with different furnishings. If not for those, I would not have known the Gate to be different from an ordinary doorway. Then I recognized that the chill I had felt was simply the coolness of the air in this room, for the day here was not as hot as the day I had left. I could feel its warm breeze at my back, coming through the Gate like a sigh. 
The shopkeeper followed behind me and called out, "Father, you have a visitor." 
A man entered the room, and who should it be but Bashaarat, twenty years younger than when I'd seen him in Baghdad. "Welcome, my lord," he said. "I am Bashaarat." 
"You do not know me?" I asked. 
"No, you must have met my older self. For me, this is our first meeting, but it is my honor to assist you." 
Your Majesty, as befits this chronicle of my shortcomings, I must confess that, so immersed was I in my own woes during the journey from Baghdad, I had not previously realized that Bashaarat had likely recognized me the moment I stepped into his shop. Even as I was admiring his water-clock and brass songbird, he had known that I would travel to Cairo, and likely knew whether I had achieved my goal or not. 
The Bashaarat I spoke to now knew none of those things. "I am doubly grateful for your kindness, sir," I said. "My name is Fuwaad ibn Abbas, newly arrived from Baghdad." 
Bashaarat's son took his leave, and Bashaarat and I conferred; I asked him the day and month, confirming that there was ample time for me to travel back to the City of Peace, and promised him I would tell him everything when I returned. His younger self was as gracious as his older. "I look forward to speaking with you on your return, and to assisting you again twenty years from now," he said. 
His words gave me pause. "Had you planned to open a shop in Baghdad before today?" 
"Why do you ask?" 
"I had been marveling at the coincidence that we met in Baghdad just in time for me to make my journey here, use the Gate, and travel back. But now I wonder if it is perhaps not a coincidence at all. Is my arrival here today the reason that you will move to Baghdad twenty years from now?" 
Bashaarat smiled. "Coincidence and intention are two sides of a tapestry, my lord. You may find one more agreeable to look at, but you cannot say one is true and the other is false." 
"Now as ever, you have given me much to think about," I said. 
I thanked him and bid farewell. As I was leaving his shop, I passed a woman entering with some haste. I heard Bashaarat greet her as Raniya, and stopped in surprise. 
From just outside the door, I could hear the woman say, "I have the necklace. I hope my older self has not lost it." 
"I am sure you will have kept it safe, in anticipation of your visit," said Bashaarat. 
I realized that this was Raniya from the story Bashaarat had told me. She was on her way to collect her older self so that they might return to the days of their youth, confound some thieves with a doubled necklace, and save their husband. For a moment I was unsure if I were dreaming or awake, because I felt as if I had stepped into a tale, and the thought that I might talk to its players and partake of its events was dizzying. I was tempted to speak, and see if I might play a hidden role in that tale, but then I remembered that my goal was to play a hidden role in my own tale. So I left without a word, and went to arrange passage with a caravan. 
It is said, Your Majesty, that Fate laughs at men's schemes. At first it appeared as if I were the most fortunate of men, for a caravan headed for Baghdad was departing within the month, and I was able to join it. In the weeks that followed I began to curse my luck, 
because the caravan's journey was plagued by delays. The wells at a town not far from Cairo were dry, and an expedition had to be sent back for water. At another village, the soldiers protecting the caravan contracted dysentery, and we had to wait for weeks for their recovery. With each delay, I revised my estimate of when we'd reach Baghdad, and grew increasingly anxious. 
Then there were the sandstorms, which seemed like a warning from Allah, and truly caused me to doubt the wisdom of my actions. We had the good fortune to be resting at a caravanserai west of Kufa when the sandstorms first struck, but our stay was prolonged from days to weeks as, time and again, the skies became clear, only to darken again as soon as the camels were reloaded. The day of Najya's accident was fast approaching, and I grew desperate. 
I solicited each of the camel drivers in turn, trying to hire one to take me ahead alone, but could not persuade any of them. Eventually I found one willing to sell me a camel at what would have been an exorbitant price under ordinary circumstances, but which I was all too willing to pay. I then struck out on my own. 
It will come as no surprise that I made little progress in the storm, but when the winds subsided, I immediately adopted a rapid pace. Without the soldiers that accompanied the caravan, however, I was an easy target for bandits, and sure enough, I was stopped after two days' ride. They took my money and the camel I had purchased, but spared my life, whether out of pity or because they could not be bothered to kill me I do not know. I began walking back to rejoin the caravan, but now the skies tormented me with their cloudlessness, and I suffered from the heat. By the time the caravan found me, my tongue was swollen and my lips were as cracked as mud baked by the sun. After that I had no choice but to accompany the caravan at its usual pace. 
Like a fading rose that drops its petals one by one, my hopes dwindled with each passing day. By the time the caravan reached the City of Peace, I knew it was too late, but the moment we rode through the city gates, I asked the guardsmen if they had heard of a mosque collapsing. The first guardsman I spoke to had not, and for a heartbeat I dared to hope that I had misremembered the date of the accident, and that I had in fact arrived in time. 
Then another guardsman told me that a mosque had indeed collapsed just yesterday in the Karkh quarter. His words struck me with the force of the executioner's axe. I had traveled so far, only to receive the worst news of my life a second time. 
I walked to the mosque, and saw the piles of bricks where there had once been a wall. It was a scene that had haunted my dreams for twenty years, but now the image remained even after I opened my eyes, and with a clarity sharper than I could endure. I turned away and walked without aim, blind to what was around me, until I found myself before my old house, the one where Najya and I had lived. I stood in the street in front of it, filled with memory and anguish. 
I do not know how much time had passed when I became aware that a young woman had walked up to me. "My lord," she said, "I'm looking for the house of Fuwaad ibn Abbas." 
"You have found it," I said.
"Are you Fuwaad ibn Abbas, my lord?" 
"I am, and I ask you, please leave me be." 
"My lord, I beg your forgiveness. My name is Maimuna, and I assist the physicians at the bimaristan. I tended to your wife before she died." 
I turned to look at her. "You tended to Najya?"
"I did, my lord. I am sworn to deliver a message to you from her."
"What message?"
"She wished me to tell you that her last thoughts were of you. She wished me to tell 
you that while her life was short, it was made happy by the time she spent with you."
She saw the tears streaming down my cheeks, and said, "Forgive me if my words 
cause you pain, my lord."
"There is nothing to forgive, child. Would that I had the means to pay you as much as 
this message is worth to me, because a lifetime of thanks would still leave me in your debt." 
"Grief owes no debt," she said. "Peace be upon you, my lord."
"Peace be upon you," I said.
She left, and I wandered the streets for hours, crying tears of release. All the while I 
thought on the truth of Bashaarat's words: past and future are the same, and we cannot change either, only know them more fully. My journey to the past had changed nothing, but what I had learned had changed everything, and I understood that it could not have been otherwise. If our lives are tales that Allah tells, then we are the audience as well as the players, and it is by living these tales that we receive their lessons. 
Night fell, and it was then that the city's guardsmen found me, wandering the streets after curfew in my dusty clothes, and asked who I was. I told them my name and where I lived, and the guardsmen brought me to my neighbors to see if they knew me, but they did not recognize me, and I was taken to jail. 
I told the guard captain my story, and he found it entertaining, but did not credit it, for who would? Then I remembered some news from my time of grief twenty years before, and told him that Your Majesty's grandson would be born an albino. Some days later, word of the infant's condition reached the captain, and he brought me to the governor of the quarter. When the governor heard my story, he brought me here to the palace, and when your lord chamberlain heard my story, he in turn brought me here to the throne room, so that I might have the infinite privilege of recounting it to Your Majesty. 
Now my tale has caught up to my life, coiled as they both are, and the direction they take next is for Your Majesty to decide. I know many things that will happen here in Baghdad over the next twenty years, but nothing about what awaits me now. I have no money for the journey back to Cairo and the Gate of Years there, yet I count myself fortunate beyond measure, for I was given the opportunity to revisit my past mistakes, and I have learned what remedies Allah allows. I would be honored to relate everything I know of the future, if Your Majesty sees fit to ask, but for myself, the most precious knowledge I possess is this: 
Nothing erases the past. There is repentance, there is atonement, and there is forgiveness. That is all, but that is enough.
